# 🗑️ Complete User Deletion Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how the **Complete Delete** functionality works in your Bueno Brows admin system, ensuring users are completely removed from both Firestore collections AND the Firebase Authentication users list.

---

## 🚨 What Happens When Admin Deletes a User While They're Logged In

### Immediate Effects:
1. **Session Termination**: User's refresh tokens are immediately revoked
2. **Authentication Invalidated**: User will be logged out on their next API call
3. **Data Deletion**: All customer data is removed from Firestore
4. **Auth Account Deleted**: User is removed from Firebase Authentication users list

### User Experience:
- **If user is actively using the app**: They'll be logged out immediately on next API call
- **If user is idle**: They'll be logged out when they try to use the app again
- **No data access**: All their appointments, messages, and data are gone

## 🔧 How Complete Deletion Works

### 1. Admin Triggers Deletion
- Admin clicks "🗑️ Complete Delete" button in Customers page
- Confirmation dialog shows exactly what will be deleted
- Admin confirms the permanent deletion

### 2. Cloud Function Execution
The `deleteCustomerData` Cloud Function performs these steps **in order**:

#### Step 1: Revoke All Sessions
```typescript
await getAuth().revokeRefreshTokens(authUser.uid);
```
- Immediately invalidates all user sessions
- User will be logged out on next API call

#### Step 2: Delete Firebase Auth Account
```typescript
await getAuth().deleteUser(authUser.uid);
```
- Removes user from Firebase Authentication users list
- User can no longer sign in

#### Step 3: Delete All Firestore Data
The function deletes from these collections:
- ✅ `appointments` - All customer appointments
- ✅ `availability` - Related time slots
- ✅ `messages` - All messages
- ✅ `conversations` - Chat conversations
- ✅ `sms_conversations` - SMS conversations
- ✅ `ai_conversations` - AI chat conversations
- ✅ `ai_sms_conversations` - AI SMS conversations
- ✅ `skinAnalyses` - Skin analysis data
- ✅ `skinAnalysisRequests` - Analysis requests
- ✅ `customerConsents` - Consent forms
- ✅ `customer_tokens` - Push notification tokens
- ✅ `reviews` - Customer reviews
- ✅ `holds` - Appointment holds
- ✅ `appointmentEditRequests` - Edit requests
- ✅ `customers` - Customer record itself

## 🎯 Complete Removal Verification

### From Firebase Console:
1. **Authentication → Users**: User will be removed from the list
2. **Firestore Database**: No customer data remains
3. **Functions Logs**: Shows detailed deletion breakdown

### From Admin Dashboard:
1. **Customers Page**: User no longer appears in the list
2. **Appointments**: All their appointments are gone
3. **Messages**: All conversations are deleted

---

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### For Admins:
- **Irreversible**: Once deleted, data cannot be recovered
- **Immediate Effect**: User is logged out immediately
- **Complete Removal**: User disappears from all systems

### For Users Being Deleted:
- **Session Ends**: They'll be logged out immediately
- **No Access**: Cannot sign in again (account deleted)
- **Data Gone**: All appointments, messages, history deleted

### For Other Users:
- **No Impact**: Other users' data is unaffected
- **System Continues**: Booking system remains functional
