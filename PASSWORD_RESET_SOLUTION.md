## 🎯 The Problem

The password reset functionality wasn't properly configured for admin accounts.

## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE SOLUTION**

Use Firebase Console to reset the admin password directly:

1. Go to Firebase Console → Authentication → Users
2. Find your admin account
3. Click "Reset password"
4. Check email and follow the reset link

## 🔧 **What I Fixed**

### 1. **Created Direct Password Reset Script** ✅
- ✅ Scripts for resetting admin passwords
- ✅ Uses Firebase Admin SDK to bypass email reset issues
- ✅ Ensures admin role is maintained

### 2. **Fixed Admin App Password Reset** ✅

- ✅ Configured redirect to admin app's `/verify` page
- ✅ Added better error handling for password reset

### 3. **Enhanced Error Handling** ✅

## 🎉 **Quick Fix Steps**

### **Option 1: Firebase Console (Recommended)**

3. Click "Reset password"
4. Check email and follow the reset link

### **Option 2: Try the "Forgot Password?" Button**

## 🔍 **Why This Happened**

1. **Password reset wasn't configured** with proper redirect URLs

## ✅ **What's Now Working**

## 🚀 **Recommended Approach**

**Use the script first** - it's the most reliable method:

```bash
node reset-regina-password.js YourSecurePassword123
```

This will:
1. ✅ Reset Regina's password immediately
2. ✅ Ensure she has admin role
3. ✅ Allow you to sign in right away

## 📋 **If You Still Have Issues**

### **Check Account Status:**
```bash
node check-admin-accounts.js
```

### **Create New Admin Account:**
```bash
node create-admin-password.js YourPassword123
```

### **Verify Firebase Console:**
1. Go to Firebase Console → Authentication → Users
2. Find `admin@yourdomain.com`
3. Check if she has admin role
4. Try manual password reset from there
