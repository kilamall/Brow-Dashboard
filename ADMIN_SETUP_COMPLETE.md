# ✅ Admin Setup Complete!

## Users with Admin Access

Both users now have the `role: "admin"` custom claim:

1. **admin@yourdomain.com** 
   - UID: `[YOUR_USER_UID]`
   - ✅ Admin role set

## 🔐 Next Steps to Log In

### Important: Users Must Sign Out and Back In

The custom claims won't take effect until the user signs out and signs back in. Here's what to do:

1. **Go to Admin Dashboard**: https://bueno-brows-admin.web.app

2. **Sign In** with your admin account:
   - admin@yourdomain.com (password or Google sign-in)

3. **If you see "Access Restricted"**:
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Clear all site data / cookies
   - Or use an incognito window
   - Sign in again

The admin dashboard should now load successfully!

## 🔒 Security: Remove the Setup Function

**IMPORTANT**: The `setAdminRoleHTTP` function should be removed now that setup is complete.

To remove it:

1. **Comment it out** in `functions/src/set-admin-role.ts`:
   ```typescript
   // Comment out or delete the entire file
   ```

2. **Remove the export** from `functions/src/index.ts`:
   ```typescript
   // export * from './set-admin-role.js';  // ← Comment this out
   ```

3. **Redeploy functions**:
   ```bash
   cd functions
   npm run build
   cd ..
   firebase deploy --only functions
   ```

Or delete the function directly:
```bash
firebase functions:delete setAdminRoleHTTP
firebase functions:delete setAdminRole
```
