# User Profile & Auto-Population Feature

## Overview
Implemented automatic population of customer information in the booking form and created a comprehensive user profile management system.

## Issues Solved

### 1. Phone Number Not Auto-Populating
**Problem**: When users logged in with phone authentication, their phone number wasn't being auto-populated into the booking form's required phone field. This forced users to manually re-enter their phone number every time.

**Solution**: Added auto-population of user data from Firebase Auth into the booking form fields.

### 2. Booking Form Not Visible for Authenticated Users
**Problem**: When authenticated users selected a time slot, they only saw a "Book now" button without any form to review or edit their information before confirming the booking.

**Solution**: Changed the authenticated user flow to show a "Review & Book" button that opens the booking form with pre-filled information, allowing users to review and edit before confirming.

### 3. No Way to Edit User Information
**Problem**: Users had no way to:
- Update their display name
- Change their email address
- Link additional phone numbers
- View their authentication methods

**Solution**: Created a comprehensive Profile page where users can manage all their account information.

## Changes Made

### 1. Auto-Population of Customer Data in Booking Form
**File**: `apps/booking/src/pages/Book.tsx`

#### Changed Authenticated User Flow (Lines 1033-1041)
For authenticated users, changed from immediate "Book now" button to "Review & Book" button that shows the form:

```typescript
) : (
  <button
    className="rounded-xl bg-terracotta px-4 py-2 text-white disabled:opacity-60 hover:bg-terracotta/90"
    onClick={() => setGuestOpen((x) => !x)}
    disabled={!hold || holdExpired}
  >
    {guestOpen ? 'Hide details' : 'Review & Book'}
  </button>
)}
```

#### Updated Form to Support Both User Types (Lines 1045-1115)
Changed form header comment and button text to work for both authenticated and guest users:

```typescript
{/* Booking information form */}
{guestOpen && hold && !holdExpired && (
  // Form fields...
  <button onClick={() => void finalizeBooking()}>
    {user ? 'Confirm booking' : 'Confirm guest booking'}
  </button>
)}
```

#### Added Auto-Population Effect (Lines 450-470)
```typescript
// Auto-populate guest form from authenticated user
useEffect(() => {
  if (user) {
    // Populate name from displayName
    if (user.displayName && !gName) {
      setGName(user.displayName);
    }
    // Populate email from user email
    if (user.email && !gEmail) {
      setGEmail(user.email);
    }
    // Populate phone from phoneNumber (for phone auth users)
    if (user.phoneNumber && !gPhone) {
      setGPhone(user.phoneNumber);
    }
    // Auto-open form for authenticated users when they have a hold
    if (hold && !guestOpen) {
      setGuestOpen(true);
    }
  }
}, [user, gName, gEmail, gPhone, hold, guestOpen]);
```

#### Updated Customer Creation to Include Phone (Lines 416-430)
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (user?.email || user?.phoneNumber) {
    findOrCreateCustomerClient({
      email: user.email || undefined,
      name: user.displayName || 'Customer',
      phone: user.phoneNumber || undefined, // Now includes phone number
    }).then(result => {
      setCustomerId(result.customerId);
    }).catch(err => {
      console.error('Failed to get customer ID:', err);
    });
  } else {
    setCustomerId(null);
  }
}, [user]);
```

    <button onClick={() => navigate('/dashboard')}>
      My Bookings

    <button onClick={() => navigate('/profile')}>
