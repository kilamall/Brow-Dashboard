# Email Verification Feature

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive email verification system to ensure users verify their email addresses for account security and reliable communications.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Automatic Verification Email on Signup**
When users create an account with email and password, they automatically receive a verification email.

**File**: `apps/booking/src/pages/Login.tsx`

```typescript
// Send email verification after signup
if (userCredential.user) {
  await sendEmailVerification(userCredential.user);
  alert('Account created! Please check your email to verify your account.');
}
```

### 2. **Email Verification Status Display**
Users can see their verification status throughout the app:
- ✅ **Profile Page**: Shows verification status with visual indicators (green checkmark or amber warning)
- ✅ **Booking Page**: Displays a notice if email is not verified

**Profile Page** (`apps/booking/src/pages/Profile.tsx`):
- Green "Verified" badge with checkmark icon for verified emails
- Amber "Not Verified" warning for unverified emails
- Prominent warning banner at the top for unverified users

**Booking Page** (`apps/booking/src/pages/Book.tsx`):
- Amber notice banner appears between service selection and date/time picker
- Includes link to profile page to complete verification

### 3. **Resend Verification Email**
Multiple locations where users can resend verification emails:

**Profile Page Banner**:
- Prominent amber warning at top of page
- "Resend Verification Email" button
- Shows loading state while sending
- Rate limit protection with helpful error message

**Email Section**:
- "Resend Verification" button next to email field (for unverified users)
- Disabled when already sending
- Clear success message after sending

### 4. **User Experience Features**

#### Visual Indicators
- ✅ **Verified**: Green checkmark with "Verified" text
- ⚠️ **Not Verified**: Amber warning icon with "Not Verified" text

#### Feedback Messages
- Success: "Verification email sent! Please check your inbox."
- Rate limiting: "Too many requests. Please wait a few minutes before trying again."

#### Smart Placement
- **Profile Page**: Warning banner at top, resend button in email section
- **Booking Page**: Gentle reminder between steps (doesn't block booking)

## User Flow

## Security & Best Practices

### Rate Limiting
Firebase automatically rate-limits verification emails to prevent abuse:
- Catches `auth/too-many-requests` error
- Shows user-friendly message
- Suggests waiting before retrying

### Non-Blocking Approach
- Email verification is **encouraged** but **not required** for booking
- Users can still book appointments without verification
- Gentle reminders instead of hard blocks
- Improves conversion while maintaining security

### Error Handling
- Graceful error handling for all verification operations
- Specific error messages for different scenarios
- Loading states prevent duplicate requests
- Success confirmations build user confidence
