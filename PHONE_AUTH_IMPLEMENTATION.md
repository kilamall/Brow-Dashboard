# Phone Authentication & Guest Booking Implementation

## üìã Overview

This document outlines the implementation of phone authentication for user sign-in and phone-only guest booking functionality.

## ‚ú® Features Implemented

### 1. Phone Authentication for Users

Users can now sign in using their phone numbers in addition to email/password and Google authentication.

#### Changes Made:

**File: `apps/booking/src/pages/Login.tsx`**

- Added tab interface to switch between Email and Phone authentication
- Integrated Firebase Phone Authentication with SMS verification
- Implemented reCAPTCHA for spam prevention
- Added two-step verification flow:
  1. User enters phone number
  2. SMS verification code is sent
  3. User enters code to complete sign-in

**Key Features:**
- Auto-formats phone numbers to E.164 format (adds +1 for US numbers)
- Invisible reCAPTCHA for seamless UX
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Support for international phone numbers (with country code)

**Code Example:**
```typescript
// Phone authentication handler
const handlePhoneAuth = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  let formattedPhone = phone.trim();
  if (!formattedPhone.startsWith('+')) {
    formattedPhone = '+1' + formattedPhone.replace(/\D/g, '');
  }
  const confirmationResult = await signInWithPhoneNumber(auth, formattedPhone, appVerifier);
  setVerificationId(confirmationResult.verificationId);
  setShowVerification(true);
};
```

### 2. Phone-Only Guest Booking

Guests can now complete bookings with just their phone number - email and name are optional.

#### Changes Made:

**File: `apps/booking/src/pages/Book.tsx`**

- Updated guest form validation to only require phone number
- Made name and email optional fields
- Updated UI to clearly indicate required vs optional fields
- Added visual styling to highlight the phone field as required
- Updated error messages to reflect phone-only requirement

**Before:**
```typescript
// Required: name AND email
disabled={!gName || !gEmail}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Required: phone only
disabled={!gPhone}
```

**File: `packages/shared/src/functionsClient.ts`**

Updated the `FindOrCreateCustomerInput` type:
```typescript
export type FindOrCreateCustomerInput = {
  email?: string;    // Now optional
  name?: string;
  phone?: string;
};
```

**File: `functions/src/find-or-create-customer.ts`**

Enhanced the Cloud Function to:
- Accept either email OR phone (at least one required)
- Search for existing customers by email first, then by phone
- Auto-update customer records when new info is provided
- Create new customers with phone-only data

**Key Features:**
```typescript
// Validation - require at least one
if (!email && !phone) {
  throw new HttpsError('invalid-argument', 'Either email or phone is required');
}

// Smart customer lookup
if (email) {
  // Try to find by email first
  existingCustomers = await db.collection('customers')
    .where('email', '==', email)
    .limit(1)
    .get();
}

// If not found by email, try phone
if ((!existingCustomers || existingCustomers.empty) && phone) {
  existingCustomers = await db.collection('customers')
    .where('phone', '==', phone)
    .limit(1)
    .get();
}
```

**File: `packages/shared/src/firestoreActions.ts`**

Added new helper function:
```typescript
export async function findCustomerByPhone(db: Firestore, phone: string): Promise<Customer | null> {
  const qy = query(collection(db, 'customers'), where('phone', '==', phone), limit(1));
  const snap = await getDocs(qy);
  if (snap.empty) return null;
  const d = snap.docs[0];
  return { id: d.id, ...(d.data() as any) } as Customer;
}
```

**File: `firebase.rules`**

Updated Firestore security rules to support phone authentication:
```javascript
match /customers/{id} {
  allow read: if isAdmin() || 
    (request.auth != null && 
     (request.auth.token.email == resource.data.email ||
      request.auth.token.phone_number == resource.data.phone));
  
  allow update: if isAdmin() || 
    (request.auth != null && 
     (request.auth.token.email == resource.data.email ||
      request.auth.token.phone_number == resource.data.phone));
}
```

## üé® UI/UX Improvements

### Login Page

- **Tabbed Interface:** Clean tab switcher between Email and Phone authentication
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Phone verification code input only shows after SMS is sent
- **Back Navigation:** Users can go back from verification to change their phone number
- **Visual Feedback:** Loading states, error messages, and success indicators

### Guest Booking Form

- **Clear Field Labels:**
  - "Full name (optional)"
  - "Email (optional)"
  - "Phone (required)*"
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Phone field has light terracotta background to indicate it's required
- **Helpful Text:** Added explanation: "Phone number is required to confirm your booking and send you appointment reminders"
- **SMS Consent:** Existing SMS opt-in checkbox preserved

---

## üîí Security Considerations

1. **reCAPTCHA Integration:** Prevents automated abuse of SMS verification
2. **Firestore Rules:** Enhanced to support both email and phone-based authentication
3. **Server-side Validation:** Cloud Function validates that at least one contact method is provided
4. **Token Verification:** Firebase Auth tokens include phone_number claim for authenticated users

---

## üì± SMS Integration

The phone authentication automatically integrates with the existing SMS system:
- Appointment confirmations sent via SMS
- Reminders sent to phone number
- AI chatbot can respond to SMS messages
- SMS consent tracked in Firestore

## üöÄ Deployment Checklist

To deploy these changes:

1. **Build the apps:**
   ```bash
   npm run build --workspace=apps/booking
   ```

2. **Deploy Firebase Functions:**
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only functions:findOrCreateCustomer
   ```

3. **Deploy Firestore Rules:**
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

4. **Deploy Hosting:**
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only hosting
   ```

## üìä Database Schema

### Customer Document (with phone-only support)

```typescript
{
  id: "auto-generated",
  name: "Guest" | string,           // Optional, defaults to "Guest"
  email: string | null,              // Optional
  phone: string | null,              // Optional (but required for guest bookings)
  status: "guest" | "approved",
  createdAt: "ISO timestamp",
  updatedAt: "ISO timestamp"
}
```

**Note:** At least one of `email` or `phone` must be provided for customer creation.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### reCAPTCHA Not Working
- **Issue:** Phone authentication fails silently
- **Solution:** Check Firebase Console > Authentication > Sign-in method > Phone > Add domain to authorized domains

### SMS Not Received
- **Issue:** Verification code never arrives
- **Solution:** 
  - Verify phone number format (must include country code)
  - Check Firebase quota limits in console
  - Ensure phone number is not blocked

### Customer Not Found by Phone
- **Issue:** Existing customer not recognized
- **Solution:** Check phone number format consistency in database (should be normalized to E.164)

### Firestore Permission Denied
- **Issue:** User can't read/update their customer record
- **Solution:** Redeploy Firestore rules to include phone_number token check
