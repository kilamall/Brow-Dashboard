# 🕐 TIMEZONE FIX DEPLOYED - PST Normalization Complete

## ✅ Issue Resolved

**Date**: January 15, 2025  
**Problem**: Client booked 4-7 PM but confirmation email showed 11 PM  
**Root Cause**: Missing timezone parameter in email functions  
**Status**: FIXED AND DEPLOYED

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

The issue was in the email confirmation system:

1. **Appointment Creation**: Times were correctly stored in UTC in the database
2. **Email Generation**: The `sendAppointmentConfirmationEmail` function was receiving pre-formatted times but wasn't getting the business timezone parameter
3. **Double Conversion**: The email function was trying to format dates again without the proper timezone context
4. **Result**: 4 PM PST became 11 PM in emails due to incorrect timezone handling

---

## 🛠️ **Fix Applied**

**Files Modified**: `functions/src/email.ts`

### **1. Updated Email Function**
```typescript
// BEFORE (problematic):
const businessTimezone = 'America/Los_Angeles'; // Hardcoded default

// AFTER (fixed):
const businessTimezone = appointmentDetails.businessTimezone || 'America/Los_Angeles';
```

### **2. Updated All Calling Functions**
Added `businessTimezone` parameter to all email function calls:

```typescript
// sendAppointmentConfirmation function
await sendAppointmentConfirmationEmail(customerEmail, customerName, {
  serviceName,
  date: start,
  time,
  duration: duration || 60,
  price: totalPrice,
  notes,
  businessTimezone, // ✅ Added timezone parameter
});

// onAppointmentConfirmedSendEmail function  
await sendAppointmentConfirmationEmail(customerEmail, customerName, {
  serviceName,
  date: start,
  time,
  duration: duration || 60,
  price: bookedPrice,
  notes,
  businessTimezone, // ✅ Added timezone parameter
});
```
