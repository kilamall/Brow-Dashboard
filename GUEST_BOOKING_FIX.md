# 🔧 Guest Booking Fix - October 15, 2025

## 🐛 **Issue**

Guest booking wasn't working. When guests tried to book without signing in, the booking would fail because the guest form fields were empty.

### The Problem:

1. **Signed-in users** - Working ✅
2. **Guest users** - Not working ❌

When a guest clicked "Book now" without filling out the guest form, the system tried to finalize the booking with empty fields, causing it to fail.

---

## ✅ **Fix Applied**

Added a validation check at the beginning of `finalizeBooking()` in `apps/booking/src/pages/Book.tsx`:

### Before:
```typescript
async function finalizeBooking() {
  if (!hold || !selectedService || !chosen) return;
  setError('');
  try {
    // ... booking logic
  }
}
```

### After:
```typescript
async function finalizeBooking() {
  if (!hold || !selectedService || !chosen) return;
  setError('');
  
  // Check if user is signed in or guest form is filled
  if (!user && !gEmail) {
    setError('Please sign in or fill out the guest form below.');
    setGuestOpen(true); // Open guest form
    return;
  }
  
  try {
    // ... booking logic
  }
}
```

## 🎯 **What This Does**

The fix adds a validation check that:

1. **Checks** if the user is signed in OR if the guest form is filled
2. **Shows an error** message: "Please sign in or fill out the guest form below."
3. **Opens the guest form** automatically so the user can fill it out
4. **Prevents** the booking from failing with empty fields
