### 3. **Quarterly Auto-Retraining**
- Automatically retrains every 3 months
- Uses your most recent conversations

## üìã Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Deploy Functions

```bash
cd functions
npm run build
cd ..
firebase deploy --only functions:trainAIFromAdminMessages,functions:generateAIResponse,functions:getFlaggedMessages,functions:markMessageReviewed,functions:quarterlyAIRetraining
```

### Step 2: Ensure Gemini API Key is Set

```bash
# Check if already set
firebase functions:config:get gemini.api_key

# If not set, add it
firebase functions:config:set gemini.api_key="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"

# Redeploy functions
firebase deploy --only functions
```

Get your Gemini API key from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey

### Step 3: Train the AI (First Time)

**Option A: From Admin Panel**
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí AI Training
2. Click "ü§ñ Train AI on My Messages"
3. Wait 1-2 minutes for training to complete
4. See stats: messages analyzed, tone, style

**Option B: From Command Line**
```javascript
// In Firebase Console or browser dev tools
const functions = getFunctions();
const trainAI = httpsCallable(functions, 'trainAIFromAdminMessages');
const result = await trainAI({ monthsBack: 3 });
console.log(result.data);
```

### Step 4: Integrate with Messaging System

Update your existing `sms-ai-integration.ts` or messaging handler to use the new trained AI:

```typescript
// When customer sends message
const functions = getFunctions();
const generateResponse = httpsCallable(functions, 'generateAIResponse');

const result = await generateResponse({
  customerId: customer.id,
  customerName: customer.name,
  customerPhone: customer.phone,
  message: customerMessage
});

if (result.data.isOutOfScope) {
  console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è Message flagged for review');
  // Send generic response (already sent by function)
} else {
  // Send AI-generated response
  await sendSMS(customer.phone, result.data.response);
}
```

## üîß How It Works

### Training Process

1. **Extract Messages** (last 3 months)
   - Fetches all admin SMS from `messages` collection
   - Groups by conversation
   - Identifies customer question ‚Üí admin response pairs

2. **Analyze Style**
   - Average response length
   - Tone detection (casual/professional/friendly)
   - Common phrases (3-word combinations)
   - Punctuation patterns
   - Greeting/closing styles

3. **Create Training Prompt**
   - Includes 20 example conversations
   - Describes admin's style profile
   - Lists business topics AI can handle
   - Defines out-of-scope detection rules

4. **Save to Firestore**
   ```
   ai_training/admin_style: Full training data
   ai_training/current_prompt: Active Gemini prompt
   ```

### Response Generation

1. **Receive Customer Message**
2. **Check Scope**
   - Business keywords: appointment, price, hours, etc.
   - Out-of-scope keywords: weather, politics, jokes, etc.
   - If out-of-scope ‚Üí Flag + Generic response
3. **Get Trained Prompt** from Firestore
4. **Get Customer Context** (past appointments, preferences)
5. **Call Gemini AI** with trained prompt + customer context
6. **Return Response** matching admin's style

### Quarterly Retraining

```
Every 3 months (automatic):
1. Extract last 3 months of admin messages
2. Re-analyze style (detect changes)
3. Update training prompt
4. Save new version
5. Notify admin of update
```

## üéì Training Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- **At least 10 admin messages** in the last 3 months
- Messages must be in `messages` collection
- Messages must have `type: 'admin'`
- Customer question ‚Üí Admin response pairs preferred

### Best Results
- **50+ messages** for accurate style learning
- Mix of different inquiries (appointments, pricing, services)
- Consistent admin responding (same person/style)
- Recent messages (last 1-3 months)

### If Not Enough Messages
```
Error: "Need at least 10 training messages. Found: 7."

Solutions:
1. Increase monthsBack parameter: trainAI({ monthsBack: 6 })
2. Wait for more customer conversations
3. Manually create sample messages for training
```

## üö© Out-of-Scope Detection

### Business Topics (AI Handles)
‚úÖ Appointment booking, rescheduling, canceling
‚úÖ Service availability and pricing
‚úÖ Business hours and location
‚úÖ Preparation instructions
‚úÖ Service recommendations
‚úÖ General salon questions

### Out-of-Scope Topics (Flagged)
üö© Weather, news, politics
üö© Personal questions about admin
üö© Medical/health advice
üö© Financial advice
üö© Technical support (non-salon)
üö© Jokes, riddles, stories
üö© "Tell me about yourself" type questions

### Generic Response
When flagged:
> "Thanks for reaching out! For that question, please call us directly or visit our website. Is there anything about our beauty services or appointments I can help with?"

---

## üì± Admin Review Workflow

### 1. View Flagged Messages
- Go to Settings ‚Üí AI Training
- Scroll to "Flagged Messages for Review"
- See customer name, phone, message, AI response

### 2. Review Each Message
- Read customer's out-of-scope question
- See what generic response was sent
- Decide if it was appropriate

### 3. Mark as Reviewed
- Click "‚úì Mark Reviewed"
- Message removed from list
- Tracked in Firestore with timestamp

### 4. Optional: Follow Up
- If customer needs real response, send manual SMS
- Update AI training if needed
- Add to FAQ if common question

---

## üîÑ Retraining Schedule

### Automatic (Recommended)
```
Every 3 months:
- Firebase Cloud Scheduler triggers `quarterlyAIRetraining`
- Extracts last 3 months of messages
- Re-analyzes style
- Updates training prompt
- Admin notified via notification
```

### Manual (As Needed)
```
When to manually retrain:
1. After major style change
2. New admin starts responding
3. Want to incorporate recent conversations
4. Quarterly auto-retrain failed
```

### Force Retrain
```javascript
const functions = getFunctions();
const trainAI = httpsCallable(functions, 'trainAIFromAdminMessages');

// Train on last 6 months instead of 3
const result = await trainAI({ monthsBack: 6 });
```

---

## üéØ Best Practices

### 1. Consistent Admin Responses
- Have one primary person respond to SMS
- If multiple admins, establish consistent style guide
- Train separately if styles differ significantly

### 2. Regular Review
- Check flagged messages weekly
- Look for patterns in out-of-scope questions
- Update FAQ if needed

### 3. Update Training After Changes
- Changed your greeting style? Retrain
- New common phrases? Retrain
- Different tone for peak season? Retrain

### 4. Monitor AI Performance
- Check `ai_interactions` collection
- Look for low-quality responses
- Retrain if style drift detected

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "AI not trained yet" Error
**Problem**: No training data found
**Solution**: Run `trainAIFromAdminMessages` first

### "Not enough messages" Error
**Problem**: Fewer than 10 admin messages found
**Solution**: 
```javascript
// Increase time range
trainAI({ monthsBack: 6 })

// Or wait for more conversations
```

### AI Responses Don't Match Style
**Problem**: Training data not representative
**Solution**:
1. Check message count (need 50+ for accuracy)
2. Verify messages are from correct admin
3. Ensure recent messages (last 3 months)
4. Retrain with more data

### Too Many Flagged Messages
**Problem**: AI being too cautious
**Solution**:
1. Review flagged topics
2. Update `detectOutOfScope` function in `ai-response-with-training.ts`
3. Add business keywords if needed
4. Redeploy functions

### Gemini API Errors
**Problem**: API key invalid or quota exceeded
**Solution**:
```bash
# Verify API key
firebase functions:config:get gemini.api_key

# Update if needed
firebase functions:config:set gemini.api_key="new_key"

# Check quota at Google AI Studio
```
