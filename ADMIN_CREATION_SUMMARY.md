## 🚀 How to Create Your Admin Account

### Step 1: Make sure the user exists
The user must sign up through your app first (they need to log in at least once).

### Step 2: Login to Firebase CLI
```bash
firebase login
firebase use default  # or your project ID
```

### Step 3: Run the secure script
```bash
node create-admin-secure.js your-email@example.com
```

### Step 4: User re-authenticates
The user must sign out and sign back in for admin privileges to activate.

**That's it!** 🎉

## 🧹 Pre-Deployment Cleanup

**IMPORTANT:** Run this before every deployment:

```bash
node cleanup-before-deploy.js
```

This script will:
- ✅ Check for sensitive files
- ✅ Verify .gitignore configuration
- ✅ Scan git history for secrets
- ✅ Check for hardcoded credentials
- ✅ Validate security posture

## 🔐 Security Best Practices Going Forward

### DO ✅
- Use `create-admin-secure.js` for all admin creation
- Run `cleanup-before-deploy.js` before every deployment
- Keep service account keys in secure secret managers
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Regularly review security logs

### DON'T ❌
- Never commit service account keys
- Never hardcode credentials in code
- Never share credentials via email/chat
- Never skip security checks before deploying
- Never commit `.env` or `.env.local` files

---

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

### If you accidentally commit a secret:

1. **STOP** - Don't push if you haven't already
2. **REVOKE** - Immediately revoke the credential in Firebase Console
3. **CLEAN** - Remove from git history (see ADMIN_SECURITY_GUIDE.md)
4. **ROTATE** - Generate new credentials
5. **VERIFY** - Run security check again

### If you need help:
- Check `ADMIN_SECURITY_GUIDE.md` for detailed troubleshooting
- Review Firebase documentation
- Run `node cleanup-before-deploy.js` for diagnostics
