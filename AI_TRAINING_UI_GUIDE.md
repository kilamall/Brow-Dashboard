## 🚩 Flagged Message Topics

### What Gets Flagged

| Topic | Examples |
|-------|----------|
| weather | "What's the weather?", "Is it raining?" |
| current_events | "Did you see the news?", "What about politics?" |
| medical | "Does this look infected?", "Medical advice?" |
| personal | "How are you feeling?", "What's your favorite...?" |
| technical | "Can you write code?", "Homework help?" |
| unclear | Very short messages without context |

### Why Flagged?
- Not business-related
- AI can't provide accurate answer
- Better handled by human admin
- Avoids inappropriate AI responses

### What Happens?
1. Customer gets generic response (polite, helpful)
2. Message logged in Firestore
3. Shows in your Flagged Messages list
4. You review & mark as handled

---

## ✅ Success Messages

### Training Completed
```
✅ AI trained successfully! 
   Analyzed 245 messages. 
   Tone: friendly
```
This means:
- Training worked
- AI learned your style
- Ready to respond to customers

### No Messages to Train
```
❌ Need at least 10 training messages. 
   Found: 7. 
   Try increasing monthsBack parameter.
```
This means:
- Not enough SMS data
- Send more messages to customers
- Or wait for more conversations

---

## ❌ Error Messages

### "AI not trained yet"
**What**: No training data found
**Fix**: Click "Train AI on My Messages" button

### "Failed to train AI"
**What**: Training process errored
**Possible causes**:
- No Gemini API key configured
- Not enough messages
- Firestore connection issue

**Fix**:
```bash
# Check Gemini API key
firebase functions:config:get gemini.api_key

# If missing, set it
firebase functions:config:set gemini.api_key="YOUR_KEY"

# Redeploy functions
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### "Failed to load flagged messages"
**What**: Can't fetch flagged messages from Firestore
**Fix**: Check browser console for specific error

---

## 🔄 Quarterly Auto-Retrain

### How It Works
- Firebase Cloud Scheduler runs every 3 months
- Function: `quarterlyAIRetraining`
- Extracts last 3 months of messages automatically
- Updates training data
- Sends notification to admin

### Notification
You'll see in Admin Notifications:
```
🤖 AI messaging style updated with 187 recent conversations
```

### If It Fails
You'll see:
```
⚠️ Quarterly AI retraining failed: [error message]
```
**Action**: Manually click "Train AI" button

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Get Better Training
1. **Respond consistently**: Same admin = better style learning
2. **More data = better AI**: Aim for 50+ messages
3. **Recent is better**: Last 3 months most relevant
4. **Review regularly**: Check flagged messages weekly

### Improve Tone Detection
- Use consistent greeting ("Hi!" vs "Hello")
- Use consistent closing ("Thanks!" vs "Thank you")
- Be consistent with emojis (all or none)
- Consistent punctuation (! vs .)

### Reduce Flagged Messages
- Customers learn what AI can handle
- Set expectations (post hours, services only)
- AI gets better with more training data

### Manual Training Triggers
- Changed your texting style
- New admin started responding
- Lots of new conversations
- Want to incorporate recent changes
