**Solution:**
- Enhanced the analysis results display with clearly labeled sections

- Added a prominent info box at the top explaining the report structure
- Improved navigation with:
  - "Back to New Analysis" button to return to upload form
  - "Request Another Analysis" button (prominently displayed)
  - Smooth scrolling when viewing past analyses
- Enhanced styling for better readability:
  - üìã Summary

  - üé® Skin Tone Analysis
  - üíÑ Foundation Match Recommendations
  - üë§ Facial Features
  - üìù Detailed Professional Analysis

### 2. ‚úÖ Customer Requests Now Appear in Admin Panel

**Problem:** When customers requested a new analysis, admins couldn't see or approve these requests.

**Solution:**
- Added a new **"Customer Requests"** tab in the Admin Skin Analyses page
- Admins can now:
  - View all skin analysis requests from customers
  - See pending requests with a red notification badge
  - Approve requests (which automatically deletes the customer's old analysis)
  - Reject requests with optional reason
  - Delete processed requests
- Added real-time updates using Firestore listeners
- Added statistics showing:
  - Total requests
  - Pending requests
  - Approved requests

## File Changes

## How It Works (Customer Flow)

   - Customer can view all sections of their analysis

2. **Viewing Past Analyses:**
   - Click "View Past Analyses" button

   - Auto-scrolls to top for easy viewing

3. **Requesting New Analysis:**
   - Customer clicks "Request Another Analysis"
   - Request is submitted to admin
   - Customer sees confirmation message
   - Customer can continue viewing current analysis while waiting

## How It Works (Admin Flow)

1. **Viewing Requests:**
   - Go to "Skin Analyses" in admin sidebar
   - Click "Customer Requests" tab
   - See all pending requests with customer email and reason

2. **Approving Request:**
   - Click "Approve" on a pending request
   - System automatically deletes customer's old analysis
   - Customer can now create a new analysis
   - Request marked as approved

3. **Rejecting Request:**
   - Click "Reject" on a pending request
   - Optionally provide reason
   - Customer's current analysis remains intact
   - Request marked as rejected

## Technical Details

### New Firestore Collection
- **Collection:** `skinAnalysisRequests`
- **Documents contain:**
  - `customerId`: User ID
  - `customerEmail`: Customer's email
  - `reason`: Optional reason for request
  - `status`: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected'
  - `requestedAt`: Timestamp
  - `approvedAt`: Timestamp (if approved)
  - `approvedBy`: Admin ID (if approved)
  - `rejectedAt`: Timestamp (if rejected)
  - `rejectedBy`: Admin ID (if rejected)
  - `adminNotes`: Optional admin notes

### Security
- All requests require authentication
- Only admins can approve/reject requests
- Customers can only create one analysis at a time
- Request system prevents spam and ensures controlled access

## Deployment

To deploy these changes:

```bash
# 1. Deploy Firestore indexes
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes

# 2. Deploy functions (if needed)
firebase deploy --only functions

# 3. Deploy hosting
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

## Testing

### Test Customer Flow:
1. Log in as a customer
2. Create a skin analysis
3. View the complete report (scroll through all sections)
4. Click "Request Another Analysis"
5. Verify confirmation message appears

### Test Admin Flow:
1. Log in as admin
2. Navigate to Skin Analyses ‚Üí Customer Requests tab
3. Verify the customer's request appears

5. Verify success message
6. Check that customer's old analysis was deleted

### Test Full Cycle:
1. Customer creates analysis
2. Customer views full report
3. Customer requests new analysis

5. Customer creates new analysis
6. Customer views new full report

## Notes

- Customers are limited to one analysis at a time to manage AI costs
- Admins must approve new analysis requests
- Old analyses are automatically deleted when requests are approved
- All analysis data remains visible to customers until deleted
- The request system is designed to prevent abuse while maintaining good UX
