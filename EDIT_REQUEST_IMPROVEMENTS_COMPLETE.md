# âœ… Edit Request and Schedule Improvements - COMPLETE

## ðŸŽ¯ All Issues Fixed and Features Implemented

### 1. âœ… Fixed Edit Request Approval Error
**Problem**: `addDoc()` called with invalid data - undefined notes field
**Solution**: 
- Fixed undefined notes handling in `EditRequests.tsx`
- Ensured notes field is never undefined when creating/updating appointments
- Added proper fallback: `notes: request.requestedChanges.notes || ''`

### 2. âœ… Wired Email Button to Edit Requests Page
**Problem**: Email button linked to wrong page
**Solution**:
- Updated email notification URL from `/appointments?editRequest=${requestId}` to `/edit-requests?highlight=${requestId}`
- Added URL parameter handling in `EditRequests.tsx` to highlight specific requests
- Added smooth scrolling and visual highlighting for the specific request

### 3. âœ… Added Attended Toggles to Past Appointments
**Problem**: No way to mark past appointments as attended/no-show
**Solution**:
- Added "Mark:" label with âœ“ (attended) and âœ— (no-show) buttons
- Buttons appear for confirmed appointments in the past appointments section
- Uses existing `handleMarkAttended` and `handleMarkNoShow` functions
- Prevents event propagation to avoid opening appointment detail modal

### 4. âœ… Added Quick Confirm/Deny for Upcoming Appointments
**Problem**: No quick way to confirm/deny pending appointments
**Solution**:
- Added inline "Confirm" and "Deny" buttons for pending appointments
- Buttons appear directly on appointment cards in upcoming section
- Added `handleQuickConfirm` and `handleQuickDeny` functions
- Updates appointment status to 'confirmed' or 'cancelled'
- Prevents event propagation to avoid opening appointment detail modal
