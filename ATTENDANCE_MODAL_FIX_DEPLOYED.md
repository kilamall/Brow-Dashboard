# 🔧 ATTENDANCE MODAL FIX DEPLOYED

## ✅ Issue Resolved

**Date**: January 15, 2025  
**Error**: `ReferenceError: appointments is not defined`  
**Root Cause**: Incorrect variable name in `handleMarkAttended` function  
**Status**: FIXED AND DEPLOYED

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

The error occurred because the `handleMarkAttended` function was trying to access `appointments[appointmentId]`, but the appointments data in the Schedule component is stored in a variable called `appts` (an array), not `appointments` (an object).

### **Problematic Code:**
```typescript
const handleMarkAttended = (appointmentId: string) => {
  const appointment = appointments[appointmentId]; // ❌ appointments is not defined
  // ...
};
```

### **Data Structure:**
- **Available**: `appts` (array of Appointment objects)
- **Expected**: `appointments` (object with appointment IDs as keys)
- **Issue**: Function was looking for wrong variable name

## 🛠️ **Fix Applied**

**File**: `apps/admin/src/pages/Schedule.tsx`  
**Function**: `handleMarkAttended`

### **Before (Broken):**
```typescript
const handleMarkAttended = (appointmentId: string) => {
  const appointment = appointments[appointmentId]; // ❌ ReferenceError
  const service = appointment ? services[appointment.serviceId] : null;
  // ...
};
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```typescript
const handleMarkAttended = (appointmentId: string) => {
  const appointment = appts.find(a => a.id === appointmentId); // ✅ Correct
  const service = appointment ? services[appointment.serviceId] : null;
  // ...
};
```
