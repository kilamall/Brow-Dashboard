## 📦 Deploy Now (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
cd /Users/kilam/Desktop/Admin-Github/Brow-Admin-Booking-Dashboard
pnpm install
```

### Step 2: Build & Deploy Functions
```bash
cd functions
npm run build
firebase deploy --only functions
```

Expected output:
```
✔  functions[analyzeSkinPhoto] deployed
✔  functions[analyzeSkinCareProducts] deployed
✔  functions[cleanupOldSkinAnalysisImages] deployed  ← NEW!
✔  functions[smsAIWebhook] deployed

```

### Step 3: Build & Deploy Frontend
```bash
cd /Users/kilam/Desktop/Admin-Github/Brow-Admin-Booking-Dashboard
pnpm build
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

---

## ✅ Verify Deployment

### 1. Check Scheduled Function
```
Firebase Console → Functions
Look for: cleanupOldSkinAnalysisImages (scheduled)
```

### 2. Test Image Compression
1. Go to your booking site `/skin-analysis`
2. Upload any image
3. Open browser console
4. Look for: `Image compressed: X% reduction`

### 3. Test AI Caching
1. Analyze a skin photo
2. Analyze the SAME photo again
3. Second analysis should be instant
4. Check Firebase Functions logs for: `Cache hit for image hash`

### 4. Check New Firestore Collections
```
Firebase Console → Firestore
New collections:
- ai_analysis_cache
- sms_ai_cache  
- chatbot_ai_cache
```

---

## 📊 Monitor Savings

### Storage Usage
```
Firebase Console → Storage
- Should stay under 1GB (not grow forever)
- Old images deleted automatically after 30 days
```

### Function Costs
```
Firebase Console → Functions → Usage
- Look for decreased Gemini API calls
- Check logs for "Cache hit" messages
```

### Firestore Reads
```
Firebase Console → Firestore → Usage
- Reads should be limited (no runaway queries)
```

---

## 🎯 What's Automatic

### No Configuration Needed!
- ✅ Images compress before upload
- ✅ AI responses cache automatically
- ✅ Old data cleans up daily at 2 AM
- ✅ Query limits prevent excessive reads

### All Features Active Immediately
Once deployed, all optimizations work automatically. No manual intervention needed!
