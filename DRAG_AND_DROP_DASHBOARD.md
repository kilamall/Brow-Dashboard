## 🔧 **Technical Implementation:**

### **Libraries Used:**

### **Files Modified:**
1. **`apps/admin/src/components/DraggableKPIGrid.tsx`** - New draggable grid component
2. **`apps/admin/src/AnalyticsHome.tsx`** - Updated to use draggable cards
3. **`apps/admin/package.json`** - Added dnd-kit dependencies

### **How It Works:**
```typescript
// KPI cards are defined as an array with unique IDs
const kpiItems = [
  { id: 'revenue', title: "Revenue", value: "$1,234", ... },
  { id: 'customers', title: "Customers", value: "42", ... },
  // ... more cards
];

// Order is saved to localStorage
localStorage.setItem('kpiOrder', JSON.stringify(orderedIds));

// Cards are sorted based on saved order
items.sort((a, b) => {
  const aIndex = kpiOrder.indexOf(a.id);
  const bIndex = kpiOrder.indexOf(b.id);
  return aIndex - bIndex;
});
```
