# ðŸš€ Simple Password Reset Solution

## ðŸŽ¯ The Problem

1. **Password reset redirects to wrong site** - Goes to `buenobrows.com/verify` instead of admin site
2. **Script fails** - Can't connect to Google metadata service
3. **Need immediate solution** - You need to get back into admin dashboard

## ðŸš€ **IMMEDIATE SOLUTION - Use Firebase Console**

This is the fastest and most reliable method:

### **Step 1: Go to Firebase Console**
1. Open: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/bueno-brows-7cce7
2. Click **Authentication** â†’ **Users**

### **Step 2: Find Your Admin Account**
1. Look for your admin email
2. Click on the user to open details

### **Step 3: Reset Password**
1. Click **"Reset password"** button
2. This will send a password reset email to your admin account
3. Check your email and click the reset link
4. Set a new password
5. Sign in to admin dashboard with new password

## ðŸ”§ **Alternative: Create New Admin Account**

If the above doesn't work, create a new admin account:

```bash
node create-admin-password.js YourNewPassword123
```

Then sign in with `admin@buenobrows.com` + your new password.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Why This Happened**

The password reset is configured to redirect to the booking site (`buenobrows.com/verify`) instead of the admin site (`bueno-brows-admin.web.app/verify`). This is a Firebase project configuration issue.

## âœ… **Quick Steps**

1. **Go to Firebase Console** â†’ Authentication â†’ Users
2. **Find your admin email**
3. **Click "Reset password"**
4. **Check email and set new password**
5. **Sign in to admin dashboard**

This should work immediately and get you back into the admin dashboard!

3. **Transfer any needed data later**
