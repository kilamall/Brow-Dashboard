# Email Dark Mode Fix - October 21, 2025

## Issue
The email confirmation display had color contrast issues:
- **Light mode**: The header text (logo and title) got washed out due to light colors on light gradient background
- **Dark mode**: The "View My Appointments" button text got washed out, appearing light on light background

## Solution
Updated the email templates to dynamically adapt to the user's display settings (light/dark mode) using CSS media queries `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` and `@media (prefers-color-scheme: light)`.

## Changes Made

### File Updated: `functions/src/email.ts`

#### 1. Confirmation Email Template
- Added `<meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark">` to enable color scheme detection
- **Light Mode Colors**:
  - Logo "BUENO": `#cc7700` (darker orange for better contrast)
  - Logo "BROWS": `#8B7355` (darker brown for better contrast)
  - Header title: `#804d00` (dark brown)
  - Button text: `#804d00` (dark brown on gold gradient)

- **Dark Mode Colors**:
  - Body background: `#1a1a1a` (dark)
  - Header gradient: Darker tones (`#cc9922` to `#b3861e`)
  - Logo "BUENO": `#ffcc33` (bright gold)
  - Logo "BROWS": `#D1B6A4` (light tan)
  - Header title: `#fff` (white)
  - Content background: `#2a2a2a` (dark gray)
  - Button: Darker gold gradient with dark text (`#1a1a1a`)
  - Text colors adjusted for better contrast on dark backgrounds

#### 2. Reminder Email Template
Applied the same dark/light mode styling to ensure consistency across all emails.

## Key Features
1. **Automatic Detection**: Email clients that support `prefers-color-scheme` will automatically apply the correct color scheme
2. **Better Contrast**: 
   - Light mode: Darker text on light backgrounds
   - Dark mode: Lighter text on dark backgrounds
3. **Consistent Branding**: Maintains Bueno Brows brand colors while ensuring readability

## Testing
To test the email appearance:

### Option 1: Deploy and Send Test Email
```bash
cd functions
npm run build
firebase deploy --only functions:onAppointmentConfirmedSendEmail,functions:resendAppointmentConfirmation
```

Then trigger a test email by:
- Creating a test appointment in the booking system
- Having an admin confirm the appointment
- Or use the "Resend Confirmation" feature in the admin dashboard

### Option 2: Preview in Email Clients
1. Open the email in different email clients:
   - Gmail (web and mobile)
   - Apple Mail (supports dark mode)
   - Outlook
   - Yahoo Mail

2. Test dark mode:
   - **iOS Mail**: Enable Dark Mode in Settings → Display & Brightness → Dark
   - **macOS Mail**: System Preferences → General → Appearance → Dark
   - **Gmail**: Settings → Theme → Dark
   - **Outlook**: Settings → Appearance → Dark Mode

### Expected Results
- ✅ **Light Mode**: Logo and header text should be clearly visible (dark brown tones)
- ✅ **Dark Mode**: All text should be clearly visible with proper contrast
- ✅ **Button**: "View My Appointments" should be readable in both modes
- ✅ **Footer**: Contact information should be visible in both modes

## Technical Details

### Color Scheme Support
Most modern email clients support `prefers-color-scheme`:
- ✅ Apple Mail (iOS 13+, macOS 10.14+)
- ✅ Outlook (iOS, Android, macOS)
- ✅ Gmail (mobile apps, some versions)
- ⚠️ Gmail web - Limited support
- ❌ Older email clients - Will fall back to light mode styles

### Fallback Strategy
If an email client doesn't support dark mode detection, it will use the default light mode styles, which are optimized for readability.
