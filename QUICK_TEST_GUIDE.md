## 🐛 Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "You already have a skin analysis" error
**Solution:** Admin needs to approve your request first OR admin needs to manually delete your old analysis

### Issue: Request doesn't appear in admin panel
**Solution:** 
- Check that you're logged in as a customer (not admin)
- Verify the request was submitted (check for green confirmation)
- Refresh the admin page
- Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Full report sections not showing
**Solution:**
- Check that the analysis status is "completed"
- Verify the analysis has the `analysis` object populated
- Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Firestore index error
**Solution:**
- Run: `firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes`
- Wait 2-3 minutes for indexes to build
- Refresh the page
