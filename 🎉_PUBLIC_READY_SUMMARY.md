## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

### Your Sites Will Keep Working
The deployed sites on Firebase are completely independent from your GitHub repository. Even if something goes wrong with Git, your live sites will continue running.

### You Have This Local Copy
Your working directory has everything. If needed, you can:
1. Make a backup: `cp -r . ../Brow-Admin-Booking-Dashboard-backup`
2. Start fresh with git if needed
3. Redeploy anytime with `firebase deploy`

---

## 💡 Recommended: Add These Files

### 1. Public README.md
Create a public-facing README explaining:
- What the project does
- How to set it up
- What technologies it uses
- How to deploy their own version

### 2. LICENSE (e.g., MIT License)
```
MIT License

Copyright (c) 2025

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy...
```

Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing/deployment
