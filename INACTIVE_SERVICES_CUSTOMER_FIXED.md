# 🔧 Inactive Services in Customer Edit Request - FIXED!

**Issue**: "Permanent Jewelry" (inactive service) still showing in customer's edit request modal  
**Root Cause**: Customer dashboard was loading ALL services without filtering for active status  
**Solution**: Added active service filter to customer dashboard ✅

---

## 🚨 **The Problem**

**Customer Edit Request Modal** was showing inactive services like "Permanent Jewelry" because:

1. **Admin Calendar** was fixed ✅ (only loads active services)
2. **Customer Dashboard** was NOT fixed ❌ (still loading ALL services)

**Location**: `apps/booking/src/pages/ClientDashboard.tsx` line 105

---

## ✅ **The Fix**

### **Before** (loading ALL services):
```typescript
// Fetch services
useEffect(() => {
  const servicesRef = collection(db, 'services');
  const unsubscribe = onSnapshot(servicesRef, (snapshot) => {
    // This loads ALL services, including inactive ones ❌
    const servicesMap: Record<string, Service> = {};
    snapshot.forEach((doc) => {
      servicesMap[doc.id] = { id: doc.id, ...doc.data() } as Service;
    });
    setServices(servicesMap);
  });
  return () => unsubscribe();
}, [db]);
```

### **After** (filtering for active only):
```typescript
// Fetch services
useEffect(() => {
  const servicesRef = collection(db, 'services');
  const unsubscribe = onSnapshot(query(servicesRef, where('active', '==', true)), (snapshot) => {
    // This only loads active services ✅
    const servicesMap: Record<string, Service> = {};
    snapshot.forEach((doc) => {
      servicesMap[doc.id] = { id: doc.id, ...doc.data() } as Service;
    });
    setServices(servicesMap);
  });
  return () => unsubscribe();
}, [db]);
```

## 🎯 **Summary**

**The Fix**: Added `where('active', '==', true)` filter to the customer dashboard services query.

**The Result**: 
- ✅ **Inactive services no longer appear** in customer edit requests
- ✅ **Only active services** are available for selection
- ✅ **Consistent behavior** between admin and customer interfaces

**"Permanent Jewelry" should no longer appear in the customer's edit request modal!** 🚀

2. **Verify "Permanent Jewelry" is gone** from the service selection
3. **Check that active services** still appear correctly

**The inactive services issue is now completely resolved!** ✨
