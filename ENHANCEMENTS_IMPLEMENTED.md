### 2. **Schedule Snapshot on Home Page** 📅

**Feature**: Dynamic schedule view that updates based on period selection

- Displays appointment details: date, time, service, customer name, and price
- Updates in real-time as you switch between period tabs

**How It Works**:

### 3. **Secure Customer Lookup** 🔒

**Feature**: Cloud Function for secure customer lookups without exposing data

**What Changed**:
- Created `findOrCreateCustomer` Cloud Function
- Client no longer needs to read customers collection directly
- Server-side lookup with admin privileges
- Prevents exposing customer data to public

**How It Works**:
1. Guest tries to book
2. Client calls `findOrCreateCustomer` Cloud Function
3. Server checks if customer exists (server-side with admin access)
4. Returns customer ID without exposing other customer data
5. If customer doesn't exist, server creates new customer record

**Files Modified**:
- `functions/src/find-or-create-customer.ts` - New Cloud Function
- `functions/src/index.ts` - Export new function
- `packages/shared/src/functionsClient.ts` - Client wrapper
- `apps/booking/src/pages/Book.tsx` - Use Cloud Function instead of direct Firestore access
- `firebase.rules` - Restored secure customer read rules
