## 🧪 Test if It's Fixed

### Option 1: Test Script
```bash
node test-gemini-api.js
```
Enter your API key when prompted. It will tell you if it's working!

### Option 2: Check Your App
1. Open your customer portal
2. Go to **Skin Analysis**
3. Upload a test photo
4. Should work without errors! ✅

### Option 3: Check Logs
```bash
firebase functions:log
```
Look for "403" errors. If none, you're good! ✅

---

## 🤔 Why Is This Needed?

**Simple explanation:**

Your Gemini API key is configured to only accept requests from specific websites (HTTP referrers). But Cloud Functions don't run in a browser—they run on Google's servers—so they can't send a "referrer" header.

**The fix:** Remove the referrer restriction so Cloud Functions can use the API key.

**Is it secure?** YES! Your API key is still protected in Firebase Secrets and only your Cloud Functions can access it.

---

## 🆘 Common Issues

### "Still getting 403 errors"
- Wait 5-10 minutes (Google needs time to propagate changes)
- Try creating a **new** API key with no restrictions
- Make sure you edited the correct API key

### "API key not found"
```bash
# Check if set
firebase functions:secrets:access GEMINI_API_KEY

# If empty, set it
firebase functions:secrets:set GEMINI_API_KEY
```

### "Don't have a Gemini API key"
1. Go to: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. Click **"Create API Key"**
3. Select your project
4. Choose **"Don't restrict key"**
5. Copy the key
6. Set it: `firebase functions:secrets:set GEMINI_API_KEY`
