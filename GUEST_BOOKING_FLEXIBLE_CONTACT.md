## üîß **Technical Changes**

### **File Modified:**
- `apps/booking/src/pages/Book.tsx`

### **Changes Made:**

#### 1. **Validation Logic** (lines 850-870)
```typescript
// Old: Required phone number
if (!gPhone) {
  setError('Phone number is required...');
  return;
}

// New: Require at least one contact method
if (!gEmail && !gPhone) {
  setError('Please provide either an email address or phone number...');
  return;
}

// Verify that at least one contact method is verified
const hasAtLeastOneVerified = emailVerified || phoneVerified;
if (!hasAtLeastOneVerified) {
  setError('Please verify your contact information...');
  return;
}
```

#### 2. **Customer Creation** (lines 700-727)
```typescript
// Old: Required phone
if (gPhone) {
  const result = await findOrCreateCustomerClient({
    email: gEmail || undefined,
    phone: gPhone, // Required
  });
}

// New: Accept either email or phone
if (gEmail || gPhone) {
  const result = await findOrCreateCustomerClient({
    email: gEmail || undefined,
    phone: gPhone || undefined, // Optional
  });
}
```

#### 3. **UI Updates** (lines 1395-1452)
- Both email and phone fields now shown as equal (no "required" marker on phone)
- Added amber info box: "At least one contact method required"
- Updated field styling to highlight when empty
- Verification section only shows for provided contact methods
- SMS consent only shows if phone number provided

#### 4. **Button Logic** (line 1570)
```typescript
// Old: Disabled if no phone or not verified
disabled={!gPhone || (!emailVerified && !phoneVerified)}

// New: Disabled if no contact method OR nothing verified
disabled={(!gEmail && !gPhone) || (!emailVerified && !phoneVerified)}
```

#### 5. **Error Messages** (lines 1577-1586)
- Shows different messages based on state:
  - No contact info: "Please provide at least one contact method"

- Customer records can have email-only, phone-only, or both

### **Data Validation:**
