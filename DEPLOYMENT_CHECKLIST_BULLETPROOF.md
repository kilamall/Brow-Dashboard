# ðŸš€ Deployment Checklist - Bullet-Proof App

## Pre-Deployment Testing

### âœ… Test Error Boundaries

1. **Test App-Wide Error Boundary**
   ```bash
   # Open any page in browser
   # Open DevTools Console
   # Run: throw new Error("Test app-wide crash")
   # Expected: See full-page error UI with "Try Again" button
   ```

2. **Test Page-Level Error Boundaries**
   - Visit `/schedule` â†’ Throw error â†’ Should see feature error UI
   - Visit `/customers` â†’ Throw error â†’ Should see feature error UI
   - Visit `/book` â†’ Throw error â†’ Should see feature error UI
   - Click "Try Again" â†’ Should recover without full reload

3. **Test Error Recovery**
   - Trigger an error
   - Click "Try Again" button
   - Verify page recovers gracefully
   - Click "Go to Home" button
   - Verify navigation works

### âœ… Test Data Loading Errors

1. **Simulate Network Error**
   ```bash
   # In DevTools â†’ Network tab
   # Set throttling to "Offline"
   # Try to load appointments/services
   # Expected: See error message with refresh button
   ```

2. **Test Empty States**
   - Create a test account with no data
   - Visit each page
   - Verify empty states show correctly (not error messages)

3. **Test Loading States**
   - Enable slow 3G throttling
   - Navigate between pages
   - Verify loading skeletons show

### âœ… Test Form Validation

1. **Services Page**
   - Try to save service with empty name â†’ Should show validation error
   - Try to save service with $0 price â†’ Should allow (valid)
   - Try to save service with negative duration â†’ Should show error

2. **Booking Page**
   - Try to book without selecting service â†’ Should show error
   - Try to book without selecting time â†’ Should show error
   - Try to book as guest without email â†’ Should show error

3. **Customer Page**
   - Try to save customer with invalid email â†’ Should show error
   - Try to save customer with invalid phone â†’ Should show error

### âœ… Test Firebase Error Logging

1. **Trigger Test Error**
   ```typescript
   // In any component, temporarily add:
   useEffect(() => {
     throw new AppError(
       'Test error for Firebase logging',
       ErrorCategory.BOOKING,
       'This is a test error message'
     );
   }, []);
   ```

2. **Verify in Firebase Console**
   - Go to Firebase Console
   - Navigate to Analytics â†’ Events
   - Look for `app_error` event
   - Verify error details are logged

3. **Clean Up**
   - Remove test error code
   - Deploy clean version

## Build & Deploy

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd /Users/kilam/Desktop/Admin-Github/Brow-Admin-Booking-Dashboard
pnpm install
```

### 2. Build All Apps

```bash
# Build everything
pnpm build

# Or build individually
pnpm --filter @buenobrows/admin build
pnpm --filter @buenobrows/booking build
```

### 3. Test Build Locally

```bash
# Preview admin build
cd apps/admin && pnpm preview

# Preview booking build
cd apps/booking && pnpm preview
```

### 4. Deploy to Firebase

```bash
# Deploy admin dashboard
firebase deploy --only hosting:admin

# Deploy booking app
firebase deploy --only hosting:booking

# Or deploy both at once
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If issues arise after deployment:

### Option 1: Rollback via Firebase Console

1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Hosting â†’ [your-site]
3. Click "Release history"
4. Find previous working version
5. Click "Rollback"

### Option 2: Revert Git Changes

```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git log  # Find commit hash before changes
git revert <commit-hash>
git push

# Redeploy
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### Option 3: Quick Fix

If it's a small issue:
1. Fix the bug locally
2. Test thoroughly
3. Rebuild and redeploy
4. Verify fix in production

## Monitoring Checklist

### Daily (First Week)

- [ ] Check Firebase Analytics for `app_error` events
- [ ] Review error messages and patterns
- [ ] Monitor user complaints/support tickets
- [ ] Check app performance metrics

### Weekly (Ongoing)

- [ ] Review error trends
- [ ] Identify common error patterns
- [ ] Update error messages if needed
- [ ] Improve error handling based on real-world data

---

## Success Metrics

After deployment, track:

1. **Error Rate**
   - Target: < 1% of page views result in errors
   - Monitor `app_error` events in Firebase

2. **User Feedback**
   - Target: No complaints about app crashes
   - Monitor support tickets

3. **Error Recovery Rate**
   - Target: > 80% of users recover from errors
   - Track "Try Again" button clicks vs "Go Home" clicks

4. **Performance**
   - Target: Pages load within 3 seconds
   - Use Lighthouse or Firebase Performance Monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Errors Still Crash the App

**Possible Causes:**
- Error boundary not wrapping component
- Error thrown outside React lifecycle
- Error in error boundary itself

**Solutions:**
1. Check error boundary is in place
2. Wrap problematic code in try-catch
3. Review browser console for details

### Issue: Errors Not Logging to Firebase

**Possible Causes:**
- Analytics not initialized
- Production environment not configured
- Network blocking analytics

**Solutions:**
1. Check Firebase Analytics is enabled in Firebase Console
2. Verify `firebase.ts` includes analytics initialization
3. Check browser network tab for blocked requests
4. Test in production (not dev/localhost)

### Issue: TypeScript Errors During Build

**Possible Causes:**
- React 19 / React Router type incompatibilities
- Missing type definitions

**Solutions:**
1. These are warnings, not blocking errors
2. Add `// @ts-ignore` if needed (not recommended)
3. Update packages: `pnpm update`
4. Wait for package updates to fix types

### Issue: Error Messages Not User-Friendly

**Solutions:**
1. Update `errorHandling.ts` default messages
2. Add more specific error categories
3. Provide better recovery actions
