## üìä Impact Analysis

### Storage Usage
- **Profile Pictures**: ~200-500 KB each (after compression)
- **1,000 customers**: ~300-500 MB total storage
- **Estimated cost**: $0.01-0.03/month
- **Compression savings**: 70-90% file size reduction

### Performance
- **Client-side compression**: No server load
- **Optimized uploads**: Smaller files = faster uploads
- **Cached previews**: Instant loading after initial fetch
- **No blocking operations**: Uploads happen asynchronously

### User Experience
- **Convenience**: One-time upload for multiple uses
- **Flexibility**: Choice between profile pic and new upload
- **Speed**: Reusing profile pic is instant (no re-upload)
- **Optional**: Users not forced to upload

---

## üîê Security Considerations

### Firebase Storage Rules ‚úÖ
- Users can only write to their own folder
- Public read access for display
- Authenticated write required

### Firebase Auth ‚úÖ
- Profile pictures linked to authenticated users
- User ID used as folder name
- No anonymous uploads to profile-images/

### Firestore Rules ‚úÖ
- Customers can create their own record
- Profile picture URL validated as string
- Admin-only deletion

### Input Validation ‚úÖ
- File type checked (images only)
- File size limited (10MB max)
- Automatic compression applied
- Preview before upload

---

## üéØ Success Metrics

### What to Track
1. **Adoption Rate**: % of new signups with profile pictures
2. **Usage Rate**: % of skin analyses using profile pictures
3. **Storage Growth**: MB added per week/month
4. **Error Rate**: Failed uploads or analyses
5. **Load Time**: Profile picture load speed

### Expected Results
- **10-30%** of customers will upload profile pictures
- **80%+** of those will use it for skin analysis
- **<1%** error rate if properly deployed
- **<500ms** load time for compressed images

---

## üöß Known Limitations

### Current Scope
1. **Single Profile Picture**: Only one profile picture per customer
2. **No Editing**: Can't crop/rotate after upload (can replace)
3. **Admin View**: Profile pictures not yet shown in admin dashboard
4. **No Galleries**: One profile pic, not a collection
