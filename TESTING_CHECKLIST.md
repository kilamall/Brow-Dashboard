## 🐛 If Something Doesn't Work:

### Admin App Issues:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Go to the problematic page
3. Copy any red error messages
4. Tell me which page has the issue

### Booking App Issues:
1. If services don't show on /services page:
   - Check console for errors
   - Verify you see console log: `[Firebase] App initialized`

2. If "Book now" doesn't work:
   - What happens when you click it?
   - Does it navigate or stay on same page?
   - Any console errors?

## 📊 Expected Current State:

**Firestore Database Should Have:**
- ✅ 5 services in `services` collection
- ✅ Business hours in `settings/businessHours`
- ✅ Analytics targets in `settings/analyticsTargets`
- ❌ No appointments yet (you need to create some)
- ❌ No customers yet (will be created when first booking happens)

## 🎯 Quick Tests:

**Can you:**
1. ✅ ❌ Log into admin app?
2. ✅ ❌ See services on admin /services page?
3. ✅ ❌ Add a new service and have it save?
4. ✅ ❌ See services on booking /services page?
5. ✅ ❌ Click "Book now" and see the booking form?

**Just reply with the ✅ or ❌ for each!**
