## 📋 Verified Features

### 1. Database Schema ✅
```typescript
interface Appointment {
  tip?: number;                // Tip amount
  totalPrice?: number;         // Service + tip
  isPriceEdited?: boolean;     // Edit flag
  priceEditedAt?: string;      // Timestamp
  priceEditedBy?: string;      // Admin who edited
}
```

### 2. UI Components ✅
- **AppointmentDetailModal:** "Edit Price" button and tip input visible
- **EditAppointmentModal:** Tip amount field with live calculations
- **All displays:** Using totalPrice for accurate revenue

### 3. Backend Functions ✅
- **holds.ts:** New appointments initialize with:
  - `totalPrice: bookedPrice`
  - `tip: 0`
  - `isPriceEdited: false`

### 4. Analytics & Tracking ✅
- Revenue calculations include tips
- Customer spending totals include tips
- All price displays use totalPrice

## 🔄 What Happens Next

### For Existing Appointments:
- ✅ Backward compatible - old appointments work fine
- ✅ Tip defaults to $0 for existing appointments
- ✅ totalPrice falls back to bookedPrice if not set

### For New Appointments:
- ✅ All fields properly initialized
