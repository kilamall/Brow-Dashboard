# Bookings Page Debugging Guide

## Current Status
✅ Environment variables configured correctly  
✅ ClientDashboard component updated with better error handling  
✅ Console logging added for debugging  
✅ Deployed to: https://bueno-brows-7cce7.web.app  

## How to Debug the Issue

### Step 1: Clear Browser Cache
**IMPORTANT**: The browser may have cached the old broken JavaScript files.

1. **Chrome/Edge**:
   - Open DevTools (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
   - Right-click the refresh button
   - Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

2. **Firefox**:
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Right-click refresh button
   - Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

3. **Safari**:
   - Go to Develop → Empty Caches
   - Then refresh (Cmd+R)

### Step 2: Check Console Logs
1. Open the booking site: https://bueno-brows-7cce7.web.app
2. Open browser DevTools (F12)
3. Go to the **Console** tab
4. Log in with a user account
5. Click "My Bookings"
6. Look for these log messages:
   ```
   [Firebase] App initialized: [DEFAULT] bueno-brows-7cce7
   [Firebase] Firestore and Auth initialized
   [ClientDashboard] Rendered, user: xxx, loading: true/false
   Found customer: xxx
   Fetched appointments: N
   ```

### Step 3: Check for Errors
Look in the Console tab for any red error messages. Common issues:

**Error: "useFirebase must be used within FirebaseProvider"**
- Solution: Clear cache and refresh

**Error: "Missing env VITE_FIREBASE_..."**
- Solution: Environment variables not loaded in production
- The app now has proper .env.local files for local development

**Error: "Failed to get document because the client is offline"**
- Solution: Check internet connection / Firestore rules

**Error: "Permission denied"**
- Solution: Check Firebase security rules

### Step 4: Test Locally
If the deployed version still has issues, test locally:

```bash
cd apps/booking
npm run dev
```

Then visit: http://localhost:5173 (or whatever port is shown)

### Step 5: Check Network Tab
1. Open DevTools → Network tab
2. Refresh the page
3. Click "My Bookings"
4. Look for:
   - ✅ JS files loading successfully (200 status)
   - ✅ Firestore API calls working
   - ❌ 404 errors (old cached files)
   - ❌ CORS errors (configuration issue)

## What's Been Fixed

### 1. Environment Variables ✅
- Created proper `.env.local` files in correct locations
- Removed incorrectly placed `src/env.local` file
- Both apps now have proper Firebase configuration

### 2. Subscription Cleanup ✅
- Fixed nested Firestore subscription cleanup
- Appointments now load properly
- No memory leaks

### 3. Service Display ✅
- Enhanced UI to match bookings page
- Shows service descriptions, duration, price
- Better visual hierarchy with icons

### 4. Empty State Handling ✅
- New users see helpful "Book Your First Appointment" message
- Better UX for users without bookings

## Testing Checklist

Try these scenarios:

### Scenario 1: New User
1. Create new account or sign in with Google
2. Click "My Bookings"
3. **Expected**: See "You haven't made a booking yet" with "Book Your First Appointment" button

### Scenario 2: Existing Customer with Bookings
1. Sign in with an account that has bookings
2. Click "My Bookings"
3. **Expected**: See upcoming appointments in beautiful cards with:
   - Service name and description
   - Date and time with icons
   - Duration and price
   - Status badge (Confirmed/Pending)
   - Cancel button

### Scenario 3: Guest User
1. Don't sign in
2. Click "Book"
3. Book as guest
4. **Expected**: Booking works, redirects to confirmation

## Still Having Issues?

### Check These:

1. **Are you testing on the deployed site?**
   - https://bueno-brows-7cce7.web.app

2. **Did you clear your cache?**
   - This is the #1 cause of persistent errors

3. **What error shows in console?**
   - Screenshot the console errors
   - Look for the specific error message

4. **Is Firebase initialized?**
   - Check console for "[Firebase] App initialized" message

5. **Are you logged in?**
   - The dashboard requires authentication

## Common Solutions

### "Page is blank"
- **Solution**: Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
- **Solution**: Clear browser cache completely
- **Solution**: Try incognito/private window

### "Loading forever"
- **Solution**: Check console for errors
- **Solution**: Verify Firebase project is active
- **Solution**: Check Firestore security rules

### "My Bookings button doesn't do anything"
- **Solution**: Check console for JavaScript errors
- **Solution**: Verify you're logged in (button should say "My Bookings" not "Login")
