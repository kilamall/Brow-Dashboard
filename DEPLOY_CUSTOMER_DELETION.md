# ðŸš€ Deploy Customer Data Deletion Feature

## Quick Deploy

### 1. Build and Deploy Cloud Function

```bash
# Navigate to functions directory
cd functions

# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Build the function
npm run build

# Deploy only the new function
firebase deploy --only functions:deleteCustomerData

# OR deploy all functions
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### 2. Build and Deploy Admin Frontend

```bash
# Navigate to admin app directory
cd apps/admin

# Build the admin app
npm run build

# Deploy admin frontend
firebase deploy --only hosting:admin

# OR from root directory
cd ../..
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

---

## Full Deployment (Recommended)

Deploy both functions and frontend in one go:

```bash
# From root directory
npm run build

# Deploy everything
firebase deploy --only functions,hosting
```

---

## Verify Deployment

### 1. Check Cloud Function

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Navigate to **Functions**
3. Verify `deleteCustomerData` function is deployed
4. Check the function logs for any errors

### 2. Test in Admin Panel

1. Open your admin panel: `https://bueno-brows-admin.web.app`
2. Log in as admin
3. Go to **Customers** page
4. Find a test customer (or create one)
5. Click **"Delete All Data"** button
6. Verify the confirmation dialogs appear
7. Complete the deletion
8. Verify success message shows deleted collections

### 3. Verify Data Deletion

Check Firebase Console to ensure data was deleted:
1. Go to **Firestore Database**
2. Verify customer record is gone
3. Check related collections (appointments, messages, etc.)
4. Confirm all related data is removed

---

## Rollback Plan

If something goes wrong:

### Rollback Cloud Function

```bash
# List recent deployments
firebase functions:list

# If needed, delete the function
firebase functions:delete deleteCustomerData
```

### Rollback Frontend

```bash
# Redeploy previous version
git checkout <previous-commit>
cd apps/admin
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting:admin
```

## What Was Changed

### New Files
1. `functions/src/delete-customer-data.ts` - Cloud Function for comprehensive deletion
2. `CUSTOMER_DATA_DELETION_GUIDE.md` - User documentation
3. `DEPLOY_CUSTOMER_DELETION.md` - This deployment guide

### Modified Files
1. `functions/src/index.ts` - Export new function
2. `packages/shared/src/functionsClient.ts` - Client wrapper for function
3. `apps/admin/src/pages/Customers.tsx` - Updated UI with new delete button

---

## Environment Variables

No new environment variables needed! The function uses existing Firebase configuration.

## Testing Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Function builds without errors
- [ ] Function deploys successfully
- [ ] Admin panel shows new "Delete All Data" button
- [ ] Confirmation dialogs appear correctly
- [ ] Test customer deletion works
- [ ] All related data is actually deleted
- [ ] Success message shows correct counts
- [ ] Error handling works (try with invalid customer ID)
- [ ] Auth account deletion works (if selected)
- [ ] Function logs show no errors

---

## Production Considerations

### Performance
- Large datasets (100+ appointments) may take 5-10 seconds
- Function has default timeout of 60 seconds (should be plenty)
- If you have customers with massive data, consider increasing timeout

### Costs
- Each deletion costs based on Firestore operations
- Average customer: ~20-50 document deletions
- Firebase free tier: 20k writes/day (plenty for deletions)

### Monitoring
- Monitor Cloud Function logs for errors
- Set up Firebase Alerts for function failures
- Track deletion frequency in Firebase Analytics (optional)

---

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Function not found"**
- Solution: Deploy the function first
- Command: `firebase deploy --only functions:deleteCustomerData`

**"Permission denied"**
- Solution: Ensure you're logged in as admin
- Check: Firebase Console â†’ Authentication â†’ User Claims

**"Timeout"**
- Solution: Customer has too much data
- Workaround: Contact support to manually delete in batches

### Need Help?

1. Check Cloud Function logs: Firebase Console â†’ Functions â†’ Logs
2. Check browser console: F12 â†’ Console tab
3. Review `CUSTOMER_DATA_DELETION_GUIDE.md` for usage help

---

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:

1. âœ… Test with a test customer account
2. âœ… Review the User Guide with your team
3. âœ… Update your data retention policy
4. âœ… Train staff on proper deletion procedures
5. âœ… Set up regular data cleanup schedule
