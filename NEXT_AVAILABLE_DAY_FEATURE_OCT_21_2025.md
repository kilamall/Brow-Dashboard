# 🗓️ Next Available Day Feature - October 21, 2025

## 🎯 **Feature Request**

User requested that when there are no available time slots for a selected day (due to all slots being booked), the system should show the next available day, just like it does when the business is closed.

### **Before:**
- When business is closed: Shows "Sorry, we are closed on this date. Our next available day is [date]."
- When no slots available: Shows only "No available time slots for this date." ❌

### **After:**
- When business is closed: Shows "Sorry, we are closed on this date. Our next available day is [date]."
- When no slots available: Shows "No available time slots for this date. Our next available day is [date]." ✅

---

## ✅ **Implementation**

### **Enhanced User Experience**

**Updated `apps/booking/src/pages/Book.tsx`:**

```typescript
// Before: Only showed next available day when business was closed
!isValidBookingDate(dayDate, bh) ? (
  // Show next available day for closed days
) : 'No available time slots for this date'

// After: Shows next available day for both closed days AND fully booked days
!isValidBookingDate(dayDate, bh) ? (
  // Show next available day for closed days
) : (
  // Show next available day for fully booked days
  <>
    <span className="text-slate-arcade">No available time slots for this date.</span>
    {(() => {
      const nextAvailable = getNextValidBookingDateAfter(dayDate, bh);
      if (nextAvailable) {
        const nextDateStr = formatNextAvailableDate(nextAvailable);
        const nextDateISO = nextAvailable.toISOString().slice(0, 10);
        return (
          <span className="block mt-1">
            Our next available day is{' '}
            <button
              onClick={() => setDateStr(nextDateISO)}
              className="font-medium text-terracotta hover:text-terracotta-dark underline cursor-pointer"
            >
              {nextDateStr}
            </button>.
          </span>
        );
      }
      return null;
    })()}
  </>
)
```

### **Key Features:**

1. **Consistent Behavior**: Now both closed days and fully booked days show the next available day
2. **Clickable Date**: The next available day is a clickable button that automatically navigates to that date
3. **Visual Styling**: Uses the same terracotta color scheme as other interactive elements
4. **Hover Effects**: Button has hover state for better UX

## 🎨 **User Experience**

### **Scenario 1: Business is Closed**
```
📅
Sorry, we are closed on this date.
Our next available day is Friday, October 31, 2025.
```

### **Scenario 2: All Time Slots Booked**
```
📅
No available time slots for this date.
Our next available day is Friday, October 31, 2025.
```

### **Interactive Element**
- The date "Friday, October 31, 2025" is clickable
- Clicking it automatically changes the date picker to that date
- The page refreshes availability for the new date

---

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **Functions Used:**
- `getNextValidBookingDateAfter(dayDate, bh)`: Finds the next business day after the current date
- `formatNextAvailableDate(nextAvailable)`: Formats the date for display
- `setDateStr(nextDateISO)`: Updates the selected date

### **Logic Flow:**
1. User selects a date with no available slots
2. System checks if it's a valid business day
3. If valid but no slots: Shows "No available time slots" + next available day
4. If invalid (closed): Shows "Sorry, we are closed" + next available day
5. User can click the next available day to automatically navigate

---

## 🧪 **Testing**

### **Test Cases:**

1. **Closed Day**: Select a Sunday (when business is closed)
   - Should show: "Sorry, we are closed on this date. Our next available day is [date]."
   - Date should be clickable

2. **Fully Booked Day**: Select a day when all time slots are taken
   - Should show: "No available time slots for this date. Our next available day is [date]."
   - Date should be clickable

3. **Available Day**: Select a day with available slots
   - Should show the available time slots
   - No next available day message

### **Expected Behavior:**
- Clicking the next available day should change the date picker
- The page should refresh and show availability for the new date
- The message should update accordingly
