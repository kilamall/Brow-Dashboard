## üñºÔ∏è Test Images to Try

### Good Test Images

**For Profile Pictures:**
- Clear face photo with good lighting

**For Skin Analysis:**
- Face photo without makeup (for accurate analysis)
- Natural lighting (near a window)
- Face directly facing camera
- Clear focus on facial features

### Test Different Sizes

Try images of different sizes to see compression:
- Small: <1MB (minimal compression needed)
- Medium: 2-4MB (good compression savings)
- Large: 5-8MB (significant compression, still good quality)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Dev server won't start

**Solution:**
```bash
# Kill any existing process on port 5174
lsof -ti:5174 | xargs kill -9

# Restart dev server
pnpm --filter @buenobrows/booking dev
```

### Issue: Profile picture not uploading

**Check:**
1. Are you logged in when trying to upload?
2. Is the image a valid image file?
3. Is the file size under 10MB?

**Look at console:**
```javascript
// Should see:
"Image compressed: XX% reduction"
"Upload successful"
```

### Issue: Profile picture option not showing

**Verify:**
1. Did you upload a profile picture during sign-up?
2. Are you logged in with the same account?
3. Check browser console for errors

**Debug:**
Open browser console and type:
```javascript
// Should show your profile picture URL
localStorage.getItem('firebase:user')
```

### Issue: Skin analysis fails

**Check:**
1. Are Firebase functions running?
2. Is Gemini API key configured?
3. Check functions logs for errors

**Note**: Skin analysis requires proper Firebase setup and API keys. If functions aren't configured yet, you can still test the upload/selection UI!
