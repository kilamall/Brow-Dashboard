```

**Budget 2: Growth Phase Alert**
```
Name:              Cost Alert - Growth Phase
Amount:            $50 USD per month
Alert Thresholds:  50%, 80%, 100%

2025-10-23 | $8.25      | $0       | $0        | $0       | $0  | Baseline - domain only
2025-11-30 | $          | $        | $         | $        | $   | 
2025-12-31 | $          | $        | $         | $        | $   | 
2026-01-31 | $          | $        | $         | $        | $   | 
```

**Additional Columns:**

**Link:** https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/[create-new]

âœ… **Done?** Update this monthly (5 minutes)

---

### âœ… Step 5: Verify Cost Optimizations Active (2 minutes)

**Why:** Ensure you're saving 60% on scaling costs

**Quick Verification Checklist:**

**Check 1: Query Limits Active**
```bash
# Open file and verify limits exist
grep -n "limit(" packages/shared/src/firestoreActions.ts
```

âœ… Expected: Should see limit(100), limit(500), limit(1000)

**Check 2: Image Compression Working**
```bash
# Check implementation
grep -n "compressImage" apps/booking/src/pages/SkinAnalysis.tsx
```

âœ… Expected: Should see compressImage function called

**Check 3: AI Caching Active**
```bash
# Check cache collections
grep -n "CACHE_COLLECTION" functions/src/skin-analysis.ts
grep -n "CACHE_COLLECTION" functions/src/ai-chatbot.ts
```

âœ… Expected: Should see cache constants defined

**Check 4: Cleanup Scheduled**
```bash
# Check scheduled function
grep -n "cleanupOldSkinAnalysisImages" functions/src/skin-analysis.ts
```

âœ… Expected: Should see onSchedule definition

**Check 5: Firebase Console - Verify Functions Deployed**
```
Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/bueno-brows-7cce7/functions
```

âœ… Expected: See `cleanupOldSkinAnalysisImages` in function list

## ðŸš¨ Cost Spike Response Plan

### If You Receive Budget Alert Email

**Step 1: Immediate Check (2 minutes)**
```
1. Open Firebase Console: 
   https://console.firebase.google.com/project/bueno-brows-7cce7/usage

2. Identify the spike:
   - [ ] Firestore reads unusual?
   - [ ] Function invocations spiked?
   - [ ] Storage suddenly increased?
   - [ ] Bandwidth spike?
```

**Step 2: Investigate (5 minutes)**
```
Check function logs:
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/bueno-brows-7cce7/functions/logs

Look for:
- [ ] Error messages repeating
- [ ] Infinite loops
- [ ] Unusual traffic patterns
- [ ] Bot/scraper activity
```

**Step 3: Mitigate (varies)**

**If Infinite Loop Detected:**
```bash
# Temporarily disable the problematic function
firebase functions:delete FUNCTION_NAME --force

# Fix the issue in code
# Redeploy
firebase deploy --only functions:FUNCTION_NAME
```

**If Bot Activity Detected:**
```
1. Check Firebase Analytics for unusual patterns
2. Review Firestore security rules
3. Consider adding rate limiting
4. Block suspicious IPs if needed
```

**If Legitimate Traffic Spike:**
```
âœ… Good problem! Your app is growing
- Update budget alerts to higher thresholds
- Monitor for a week to establish new baseline
- Review optimizations for efficiency
```

**Step 4: Document**
```
In cost tracking spreadsheet:
- Record the spike
- Note the cause
- Document the resolution
- Update projections if needed
```
