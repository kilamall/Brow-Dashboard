### Step 3: Test Deletion (Use Test Customer!)
1. **Create a test customer first** (or use an existing test account)
2. Click **"Delete All Data"** button
3. **First Dialog** should appear:
   ```

   This will permanently delete ALL customer data including:
   ‚Ä¢ Customer profile and contact information
   ‚Ä¢ All appointments and booking history
   ‚Ä¢ All messages and conversations
   ‚Ä¢ All SMS conversations

   This action cannot be undone!
   ```
4. Click **OK**

   ```
   Do you also want to delete their Firebase Authentication account?
   
   Click OK to delete both data AND auth account.
   Click Cancel to delete only data (keep auth account).
   ```
6. Choose an option (OK or Cancel)
7. **Success Dialog** should appear with deletion details:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Success!

   ‚Ä¢ messages: X
   ...
   ```

### Step 4: Verify Data Deletion
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/bueno-brows-7cce7)
2. Navigate to **Firestore Database**
3. Check that customer record is gone from `customers` collection
4. Verify related data is deleted:
   - Check `appointments` collection
   - Check `messages` collection
   - Check `conversations` collection
   - Check other related collections

### Step 5: Check Function Logs
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/bueno-brows-7cce7)
2. Navigate to **Functions** ‚Üí **Logs**
3. Look for `deleteCustomerData` function execution
4. Verify:
   - [ ] Function executed successfully
   - [ ] No errors in logs
   - [ ] See log entries for each collection deletion

## üéØ Expected Behavior

### Success Case
- Two confirmation dialogs appear
- User confirms both
- Function executes (may take 2-10 seconds)
- Success dialog shows detailed breakdown
- Customer disappears from list
- All related data is removed from Firebase

### Error Cases (What to Check)

#### "Permission denied"
- **Cause**: Not logged in as admin
- **Fix**: Verify admin role in Firebase Console ‚Üí Authentication

#### "Function not found"
- **Cause**: Function didn't deploy properly
- **Fix**: Check Functions in Firebase Console, redeploy if needed

#### "Failed to delete customer"
- **Cause**: Network issue or function timeout
- **Fix**: Check internet connection, try again, check function logs
