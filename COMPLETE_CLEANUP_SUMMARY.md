## ⚠️ Important Reminders

### Before Production
1. **Enable Firestore Backups**
   - 7-day retention recommended
   - Cannot recover without backups
   
2. **Test in Staging**
   - Deploy to staging first
   - Run manual cleanup
   - Verify no critical data lost

3. **Review Retention Periods**
   - Ensure they match business needs
   - Consider regulatory requirements
   - Document any changes

### Ongoing
- Monitor cleanup logs weekly
- Review storage metrics monthly
- Adjust retention periods as needed
- Keep backups enabled always

---

## 🔄 Migration Notes

### If Using Old `auto-cleanup.ts`

The new `enhanced-auto-cleanup.ts` is **backwards compatible** and includes everything from the old version plus 9 additional categories.

**Options:**
1. **Run Both** (safest initially)
   - Keep old cleanup running
   - Add new enhanced cleanup
   - Compare results for a month
   - Disable old cleanup once confident

2. **Replace** (recommended long-term)
   - Disable old `autoCleanup` function
   - Use only `enhancedAutoCleanup`
   - Monitor for any issues

**To Disable Old Cleanup:**
```typescript
// In functions/src/index.ts, comment out:
// export * from './auto-cleanup.js';
```
