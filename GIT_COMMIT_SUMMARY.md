3. **Permission Errors**: Added missing delete rules for edit requests
4. **Customer Profile Creation**: Fixed for SMS-verified users
5. **Visit Count Logic**: Aligned across all components and functions
6. **Purge Data Modal**: Now loads collection counts when opened

## üìà Performance Improvements

## üöÄ Deployment Status

## üìö Documentation

New documentation files:
- `EDIT_REQUEST_CLEANUP_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Complete feature documentation
- `GIT_COMMIT_SUMMARY.md` - This file (commit reference)
- `CALENDAR_HIGHLIGHTING_DEPLOYED.md` - Calendar feature deployment notes

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Composite Index**: The edit request cleanup requires a composite index on `appointmentEditRequests` collection (status + processedAt). This should auto-create when the function first runs.

2. **Customer Visit Counts**: Historical data for existing customers may still show incorrect counts. Run "Sync Visits" from Data Management to recalculate.

3. **Merged Customers**: Customers with `identityStatus: 'migrated'` are now hidden from the admin UI but still exist in the database for data integrity.

4. **Edit Request Filtering**: Customer dashboard now shows ONLY pending requests. Approved/denied requests are hidden to reduce clutter.
