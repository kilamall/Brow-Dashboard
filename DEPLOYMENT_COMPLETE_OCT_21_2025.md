## 🎯 Expected Outcomes

### Immediate Benefits:
1. **Customers can edit appointments** - Reduce cancellations
2. **One-click rebooking** - Increase repeat bookings
3. **Admin efficiency** - Faster rebooking for loyal customers
4. **Better UX** - Professional, modern interface
5. **Fewer errors** - Hold creation improvements reduce booking issues

### Metrics to Monitor (Week 1):
- Number of "Book Again" clicks
- Number of appointment edits (vs cancellations)
- Number of admin quick rebooks
- Customer support tickets (should decrease)
- Booking completion rate (should increase)
- Duplicate hold errors (should be zero)

## 🐛 Known Limitations (By Design)

### Edit Appointments:
- ❌ Cannot change service type (must cancel & rebook)
- ❌ Cannot change price (locked to service price)
- ✅ Can only change date and time

**Why?** These limitations maintain pricing integrity, prevent calculation errors, and simplify the interface.

### Quick Rebook:
- Sets date to exactly 2 weeks ahead (adjustable in modal)
- Assumes customer wants same service (changeable in modal)

## 🔄 Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If any critical issues arise:

```bash
# Option 1: Firebase Console Rollback
# Go to Firebase Console > Hosting > View previous versions > Rollback

# Option 2: Command Line Rollback
firebase hosting:rollback

# Option 3: Redeploy Previous Version
git log --oneline -10  # Find previous commit
git checkout <previous-commit-hash>
pnpm install && pnpm build
firebase deploy --only hosting
git checkout main  # Return to current version
```
