# üîß Booking State Restoration Fix - October 21, 2025

## üêõ **Issues Fixed**

### Problem 1: Date Selection Lost After Sign-In
**Symptom:** When users selected a date/time and clicked "Sign in to book", after signing in and returning to the booking page, their previously selected date was reset to today or the next available date.

**Root Cause:** 
- The date was correctly restored from `sessionStorage` on initial state (lines 169-182)
- BUT the `useEffect` on lines 187-195 would unconditionally overwrite the restored date with "next valid booking date" when business hours loaded
- This happened AFTER the page reload from authentication, causing the user's selection to be lost

**Fix:**
- Added `hasInitializedDate` state tracker to remember if we already loaded a date from storage
- The auto-date-selection effect now only runs if we haven't already restored a date from sessionStorage
- This preserves the user's selected date across navigation/authentication flows

```typescript
// Track if we've initialized the date from business hours
const [hasInitializedDate, setHasInitializedDate] = useState(() => {
  // If we restored a date from storage, consider it initialized
  const saved = sessionStorage.getItem('bb_booking_cart');
  if (saved) {
    try {
      const cart = JSON.parse(saved);
      return !!cart.dateStr;
    } catch (e) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return false;
});

// Update to next valid date when business hours are loaded 
// (only once, and only if not restored from storage)
useEffect(() => {
  if (bh && selectedServices.length > 0 && !hasInitializedDate) {
    const nextValidDate = getNextValidBookingDate(bh);
    if (nextValidDate) {
      const nextValidDateStr = nextValidDate.toISOString().slice(0, 10);
      setDateStr(nextValidDateStr);
      setHasInitializedDate(true);
    }
  }
}, [bh, selectedServices, hasInitializedDate]);
```

### Problem 2: Spinning Wheel at Bottom of Screen
**Symptom:** After clicking "Sign in to book" and returning, a small spinning wheel or "Creating hold‚Ä¶" message appeared at the bottom of the screen while the hold was being restored.

**Root Cause:**
- The hold restoration had a 1-second delay (line 448: `setTimeout(..., 1000)`)
- During this delay, the UI showed `chosen` slot but no `hold` yet
- This triggered the "Creating hold‚Ä¶" message in the booking form
- No visual feedback about the restoration process

**Fix:**
- Reduced delay from 1000ms to 500ms for faster restoration
- Added `isRestoringHold` state to track the restoration process
- Added a prominent blue progress banner when restoring:
  ```typescript
  {isRestoringHold && !hold && (
    <div className="mb-3 bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 rounded-lg p-3">
      <div className="flex items-center gap-3">
        <div className="animate-spin rounded-full h-4 w-4 border-2 border-blue-600 border-t-transparent"></div>
        <div className="flex-1">
          <p className="text-sm font-medium text-blue-900">Restoring your selection...</p>
          <p className="text-xs text-blue-700">Please wait while we secure your time slot</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )}
  ```
- Updated the countdown text to show "Restoring your booking‚Ä¶" instead of generic "Creating hold‚Ä¶"

---

### Problem 3: User Has to Scroll Down Again
**Symptom:** After signing in, users were returned to the top of the page and had to scroll back down to the booking form to see their selected time.

**Fix:**
- Added `bookingFormRef` to track the booking form div
- After hold restoration completes, automatically scroll to the booking form with smooth animation:
  ```typescript
  pickSlot(chosen).finally(() => {
    setIsRestoringHold(false);
    // Scroll to the booking form after a short delay
    setTimeout(() => {
      bookingFormRef.current?.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'center' });
    }, 300);
  });
  ```

## ‚úÖ **How It Works Now**

### Happy Path Flow:
1. **User selects service(s), date, and time** ‚Üí State saved to `sessionStorage`
2. **User clicks "Sign in to book"** ‚Üí Navigates to `/login?returnTo=/book`
3. **User signs in** ‚Üí Redirects back to `/book`
4. **Page loads:**
   - ‚úÖ Services restored from `sessionStorage`
   - ‚úÖ Date restored from `sessionStorage` (NOT overwritten)
   - ‚úÖ Time slot restored from `sessionStorage`
5. **Hold restoration begins:**
   - Blue progress banner appears: "Restoring your selection..."
   - Spinner shows restoration in progress
   - Takes ~500ms
6. **Hold restoration completes:**
   - Progress banner disappears
   - Booking form shows active hold with countdown timer
   - Page automatically scrolls to booking form
   - User sees their selected time is still selected ‚úÖ
7. **User can immediately proceed** to confirm booking

## üéØ **User Experience Improvements**

### Before:
- ‚ùå Selected date would reset to today/next available
- ‚ùå Confusing "Creating hold‚Ä¶" message with no context
- ‚ùå User had to scroll down to find booking form
- ‚ùå Felt broken/unreliable

### After:
- ‚úÖ Selected date persists across sign-in
- ‚úÖ Clear "Restoring your selection..." message with spinner
- ‚úÖ Auto-scrolls to booking form when ready
- ‚úÖ Smooth, professional experience
- ‚úÖ User confidence that their selection is preserved

## üìù **Notes**

- The fix maintains all existing functionality
- No changes to booking flow logic or hold creation
- Purely UI/UX improvements
- State persistence already existed, just needed better handling
- Auto-scroll is smooth and non-intrusive

## üéâ **Summary**

This fix transforms the booking experience from feeling broken to feeling polished and professional. Users can now confidently sign in mid-booking without losing their selections, and they get clear visual feedback about what's happening. The auto-scroll ensures they don't have to hunt for their booking form after authentication.

**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready for production deployment
