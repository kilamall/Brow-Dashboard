## ⚠️ Important: Action Required

### 🔴 Critical - Do This Now

**Revoke Old Exposed API Key**

The old Gemini API key that was previously exposed is still in the Firebase config (though not being used by the code):

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console API Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Find and delete this key: `AIzaSyAsIbSKd9x7Gtn7KtHg5oIBG2zvV1_RgVc`
3. Your app is using the new secure key: `AIzaSyDxXI9OjWyL3y0XUUZmrydOE7N3kMMK-sU`

**After Verification** (optional cleanup):
```bash
# Remove deprecated config
firebase functions:config:unset gemini
firebase functions:config:unset twilio
firebase functions:config:unset sendgrid
```
