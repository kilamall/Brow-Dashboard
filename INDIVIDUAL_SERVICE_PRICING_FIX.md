# üéØ Individual Service Pricing Fix - Multi-Service Appointments

## ‚úÖ **Problem Solved**

**Issue**: When booking appointments with multiple services, the enhanced modal only allowed editing a single total price for all services combined, making it impossible to track cost/profit per individual service.

**Solution**: Implemented individual service pricing system that allows admins to set and edit prices for each service separately in multi-service appointments.

## üîß **Changes Made**

### 1. **Updated Data Structure** (`packages/shared/src/types.ts`)

**Added new field to Appointment interface:**
```typescript
servicePrices?: Record<string, number>; // Individual prices per service ID for multi-service appointments
```

**Updated comments for clarity:**
- `bookedPrice` - Legacy field - total price for all services
- `totalPrice` - Calculated total (sum of servicePrices + tip, or bookedPrice + tip for legacy)

### 2. **Enhanced Appointment Detail Modal** (`apps/admin/src/components/EnhancedAppointmentDetailModal.tsx`)

**New Features:**
- **Individual Service Price Inputs**: For multi-service appointments, shows separate price input for each service
- **Smart Price Detection**: Automatically detects if appointment uses individual prices or legacy single price
- **Backward Compatibility**: Still works with existing single-price appointments
- **Real-time Total Calculation**: Shows services subtotal and final total including tips

**UI Improvements:**
- Blue info box explaining individual pricing benefits
- Numbered service cards with default prices shown
- Services subtotal calculation
- Responsive modal with scroll support for many services

### 3. **Updated Appointment Creation** (`apps/admin/src/components/AddAppointmentModal.tsx`)

**Enhanced Logic:**
- Creates appointments with both `bookedPrice` (legacy) and `servicePrices` (new)
- Stores individual service prices from service definitions
- Maintains backward compatibility

### 4. **Updated Appointment Editing** (`apps/admin/src/components/EditAppointmentModal.tsx`)

**Enhanced Logic:**
- Updates both legacy and new price fields when editing appointments
- Maintains individual service price tracking
- Fixed type compatibility issues
