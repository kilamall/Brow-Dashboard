# 🚨 Quick Fix: Delete Pending Analysis

## The Problem
You have a **pending** skin analysis in the database that's blocking new uploads. The admin panel shows:
- 1 Total Analysis
- 1 Pending (not completed)
- 0 Completed

## Solution: Delete via Firebase Console

### Step 1: Open Firebase Console
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select your project: `bueno-brows-7cce7`
3. Click "Firestore Database" in the left menu

### Step 2: Find and Delete the Pending Analysis
1. Click on the `skinAnalyses` collection
2. Look for the document with:
   - `customerEmail`: "admin@yourdomain.com"
   - `status`: "pending"
3. Click on that document
4. Click the **trash/delete icon** (🗑️)
5. Confirm deletion

### Step 3: Also Check for Analysis Requests
1. Click on the `skinAnalysisRequests` collection
2. Look for any documents with your email
3. Delete those too if they exist

### Step 4: Test
1. Go back to: https://bueno-brows-7cce7.web.app/skin-analysis
2. Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` or `Cmd+Shift+R`
3. Try uploading a new photo
4. Should work now!

## Alternative: Use Browser Console

If you can't access Firebase Console, open browser console (F12) and run:

```javascript
// Delete all analyses for current user
firebase.firestore().collection('skinAnalyses')
  .where('customerId', '==', firebase.auth().currentUser.uid)
  .get()
  .then(snapshot => {
    snapshot.forEach(doc => {
      doc.ref.delete().then(() => {
        console.log('Deleted analysis:', doc.id);
      });
    });
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log('All analyses deleted. Refresh page and try again.');
  });
```

## Why This Happened
The analysis got stuck in "pending" status, probably because:
1. The AI analysis failed to complete
2. The image processing had an error
3. The Cloud Function didn't finish properly

Deleting the pending analysis will allow you to start fresh.
