# Multi-Guest Booking - Test Results

## Branch: `feature/multi-guest-booking`
## Status: ✅ Core Implementation Complete, Ready for Full Manual Testing

## Test Session Summary (Dec 4, 2025)

### ✅ Tests Passed

#### 1. Page Load & Rendering
- **Result**: ✅ PASS
- **Details**: Booking page loads without errors after fixing bugs
- **Proof**: Screenshots show clean UI with quantity controls

#### 2. Quantity Controls UI
- **Result**: ✅ PASS
- **Details**: 
  - All services show +/- buttons
  - Quantity displays correctly
  - Visual feedback works (highlighted border for selected services)
- **Proof**: Screenshot shows "Brow Lamination + Wax" with quantity "1"

#### 3. Guest Modal Trigger
- **Result**: ✅ PASS
- **Details**:
  - Clicking + on first service → quantity increases to 1 (no modal)
  - Clicking + again → quantity increases to 2, "Add Guest" modal appears
  - Smart logic working as designed
- **Proof**: Screenshot shows "Add Guest" modal with all fields

#### 4. Modal UI Components
- **Result**: ✅ PASS
- **Details**:
  - Guest Name field (required) - present
  - Email field (optional) - present
  - Phone field (optional) - present
  - Cancel button - present
  - Add Guest button - present
- **Proof**: Screenshot shows complete modal form

### 🐛 Bugs Fixed During Testing

#### Bug #1: Variable Hoisting
- **Issue**: "Cannot access 'user' before initialization"
- **Cause**: Guest initialization useEffect used `user` variable before it was declared
- **Fix**: Moved guest init useEffect after user state declaration
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed & Committed

#### Bug #2: Duplicate useEffect Race Condition
- **Issue**: Two separate useEffect hooks both initializing "self" guest
- **Cause**: One at line 986-992, another at 1064-1079
- **Impact**: Race condition, conflicting dependencies, redundant initializations
- **Fix**: Removed first duplicate, improved second with comprehensive logic
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed & Committed

#### Bug #3: Duplicate Function Definitions
- **Issue**: assignServiceToGuest and removeGuest defined twice
- **Cause**: Functions defined around line 424-465 AND again at 2032-2070
- **Impact**: Linter errors, potential runtime conflicts
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate definitions at lines 2032-2070
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed & Committed

### 📊 Manual Testing Needed

The following still need manual verification:

#### 1. Guest Addition Flow
- [ ] Click "Add Guest" button with valid name
- [ ] Verify guest is added to guest list
- [ ] Verify service is assigned to new guest
- [ ] Check quantity display shows "2"

#### 2. Guest List Display (Authenticated Users)
- [ ] Log in as a user
- [ ] Verify "self" guest appears
- [ ] Add additional guests
- [ ] Verify "+ Add Guest" button works
- [ ] Verify Remove guest button works (except for self)

#### 3. Service Summary
- [ ] Select multiple services with quantities
- [ ] Scroll down to see "Your Selection" summary
- [ ] Verify it shows:
  - Service name × quantity
  - Guest assignments under each service
  - Price per guest
  - Total price calculation

#### 4. Complete Booking Flow
- [ ] Add multiple guests
- [ ] Assign services to different guests
- [ ] Select a time slot (hold creation)
- [ ] Complete booking
- [ ] Verify appointment created with correct service IDs

### 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Manual Testing**: Complete the checklist above
2. **Edge Case Testing**:
   - Remove a guest with assigned services
   - Increase/decrease quantities rapidly
   - Switch between logged in/logged out states
