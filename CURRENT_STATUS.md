## ‚ùó Known Issues Still to Fix:

**TODO**: Add delete button to appointment cards in Calendar.tsx

### 2. Weekly View on Admin Home
**Issue**: No weekly schedule overview on dashboard
**TODO**: Add weekly calendar widget to AnalyticsHome.tsx

### 3. Booking Flow
**Issue**: User reported booking flow not working
**Need**: Test if:
- Services appear on /book page?
- Time slots show after selecting service?
- Can complete booking?

### 4. Services Not Showing on Booking App
**Need**: Verify on http://localhost:5174/services
- Do the 5 services appear?
- If not, check browser console for errors

## üîç Debugging Steps:

### If Content Still Disappears:

1. **Check localhost:5173** (admin app)
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Console tab
   - What errors appear?

2. **Check localhost:5174** (booking app)
   - Go to /services page
   - Do services appear?
   - Any console errors?

### What to Look For:

**Good Signs:**
- Console log: `[Firebase] App initialized: [DEFAULT] bueno-brows-7cce7`
- Console log: `[Firebase] Firestore and Auth initialized`
- NO errors about "Service firestore is not available"
- NO errors about "Cannot read properties of undefined"

**Bad Signs (tell me if you see these):**
- Red errors in console
- Content flashes then disappears
- Blank white page
- Loading spinner that never ends
