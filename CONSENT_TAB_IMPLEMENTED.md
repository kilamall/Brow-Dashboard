## 🔒 Security

### Firestore Security Rules
- ✅ Admins can view **all** consent records
- ✅ Customers can view **only their own** consents
- ✅ Consent records are **immutable** (only admins can modify for audit compliance)
- ✅ Both authenticated and guest users can create consents (for booking flow)

### Firestore Indexes
Added index for efficient querying:
- `customerConsents` collection indexed by `customerId` + `consentedAt` (descending)

## 📊 Database Structure

### Collections
- **`consentFormTemplates`**: The master consent forms (created by admins)
- **`customerConsents`**: Individual customer consent records

### Sample Consent Record
```json
{
  "id": "abc123",
  "customerId": "cust_456",
  "customerName": "Jane Doe",
  "customerEmail": "jane@example.com",
  "customerPhone": "+1234567890",
  "consentFormId": "form_789",
  "consentFormVersion": "1.0",
  "consentFormCategory": "brow_services",
  "agreed": true,
  "signature": "Jane Doe",
  "ipAddress": "192.168.1.1",
  "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
  "consentedAt": "2025-10-19T10:30:00Z",
  "needsRenewal": false,
  "appointmentId": "appt_123"
}
```

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. **`apps/admin/src/pages/Settings.tsx`**
   - Added `consent` tab type
   - Created `ConsentFormsManager` component
   - Created `ConsentDetailModal` component
   - Added imports for Firestore queries

2. **`firestore.indexes.json`**
   - Added index for `customerConsents` collection

### Dependencies Used
- Existing `@buenobrows/shared/consentFormHelpers.ts` functions
- Firestore real-time listeners (`onSnapshot`)
- Date formatting (`date-fns`)

## 📝 Existing Helper Functions

The following helper functions are available in `@buenobrows/shared/consentFormHelpers.ts`:

- `getActiveConsentForm(db, category)` - Get active consent form for a category
- `watchActiveConsentForm(db, category, callback)` - Real-time listener for active form
- `recordCustomerConsent(db, consent)` - Save a new consent record
- `hasValidConsent(db, customerId, category)` - Check if customer has valid consent
- `getCustomerConsents(db, customerId)` - Get all consents for a customer
- `watchCustomerConsents(db, customerId, callback)` - Real-time listener for customer consents
- `flagConsentsForRenewal(db, oldFormId, category)` - Mark consents for renewal when form updates
- `initializeDefaultConsentForms(db)` - Create default form templates

## 🔧 Initialization

If you don't have any consent forms yet, run:

```bash
node initialize-consent-forms.js
```

This will create the default "Brow & Lash Services Consent" form with all sections.
