## 🎯 What Customers See

|------|---------------|
| **After Booking** | "Appointment pending confirmation" |
| **After You Confirm** | ✅ SMS/Email confirmation |
| **If You Reject** | ❌ Nothing (silent rejection) |

## ⚙️ Important Changes

### ❗ NEW WORKFLOW:
- Customers **DON'T get confirmation** immediately
- **YOU must confirm** each appointment
- Confirmations sent **when you click button**

### Before:
Customer books → ✅ **Instant confirmation**

### Now:
Customer books → ⏳ **Awaits your approval** → You confirm → ✅ **Then they get confirmation**

## 💡 Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Check pending appointments daily
- Confirm within 1-2 hours

- Verify customer details

❌ **DON'T:**
