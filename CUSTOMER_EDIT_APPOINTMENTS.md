# Customer Edit Appointments Feature

## Overview
Customers can now edit their upcoming appointments directly from the "My Bookings" dashboard, allowing them to change the date and time without needing to cancel and rebook.

## Features

### 1. Edit Button on Upcoming Appointments
**Location:** Customer Dashboard (`/dashboard`)

**What was added:**
- "Edit" button next to "Cancel" on all upcoming appointments
- Styled in terracotta color to match the brand
- Only appears for appointments that haven't passed yet

### 2. Edit Appointment Modal
**Component:** `apps/booking/src/components/EditAppointmentModal.tsx`

**Features:**
- **Date Selection:** Dropdown showing next 60 days
- **Time Selection:** Grid of available time slots for selected date
- **Real-time Availability:** Checks for conflicts with other appointments
- **Service Lock:** Cannot change the service (only date/time)
- **Current Appointment Display:** Shows current booking details for reference

**Functionality:**
- Displays current appointment details at the top
- Shows all available dates (next 60 days)
- When date is selected, fetches available time slots
- Automatically filters out the current appointment when checking availability
- Prevents double-booking
- Updates appointment in Firestore

### 3. User Experience Flow

1. Customer logs into dashboard
2. Views "Upcoming Appointments" section
3. Clicks "Edit" button on an appointment
4. Modal opens showing:
   - Current appointment date/time
   - Date selector (dropdown)
   - Time selector (grid of available slots)
5. Customer selects new date
6. Available times load for that date
7. Customer selects new time
8. Clicks "Save Changes"
9. Confirmation message appears
10. Modal closes and appointment list updates

## Technical Implementation

### Files Created
- `apps/booking/src/components/EditAppointmentModal.tsx` - The edit modal component

### Files Modified
- `apps/booking/src/pages/ClientDashboard.tsx` - Added edit button and modal integration

### Key Features

#### Availability Checking
```typescript
// Filters out current appointment to avoid false conflicts
const otherAppointments = allAppointments.filter(
  apt => apt.id !== appointment.id && apt.status !== 'cancelled'
);
const slots = availableSlotsForDay(date, appointment.duration, bh, otherAppointments);
```

#### Real-time Updates
- Uses existing onSnapshot listener
- Appointments automatically refresh after update
- No page reload required

#### Service Restriction
- Users cannot change the service type
- Note displayed: "To change the service, please cancel this appointment and book a new one"
- This prevents confusion and maintains data integrity

### State Management
```typescript
const [editingAppointment, setEditingAppointment] = useState<Appointment | null>(null);
```

### Firestore Update
```typescript
await updateDoc(doc(db, 'appointments', appointment.id), {
  start: newStartISO,
  updatedAt: new Date().toISOString()
});
```

## User Benefits

### For Customers:
- **Flexibility:** Easy to reschedule without canceling
- **No Re-entry:** Keep the same service selection
- **Clear Availability:** See all available times at a glance
- **Quick Changes:** Update in seconds, not minutes
- **Better Experience:** Professional, modern interface

### For Business:
- **Reduced Cancellations:** Customers reschedule instead of cancel
- **Better Retention:** Lower friction to adjust appointments
- **Fewer No-Shows:** Easier to move appointments that might otherwise be missed
- **Professional Image:** Modern self-service capability

## Limitations & Design Decisions

### What Can Be Changed:
- ✅ Date
- ✅ Time

### What Cannot Be Changed:
- ❌ Service type
- ❌ Duration
- ❌ Price

**Why?** These limitations:
1. Prevent complex recalculations
2. Maintain pricing integrity
3. Ensure availability calculations remain accurate
4. Simplify the user interface
5. Reduce potential errors

### Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Allow service changes with price recalculation
- Add notes/special requests during edit
- Show business hours on the modal
- Add ability to edit multiple appointments at once
- Email notification when customer edits appointment

## Error Handling

### No Available Slots

"Please select a different date"
```

### Save Failure
```
"Failed to update appointment"
+ specific error message from Firebase
```

### Missing Selection
```
"Please select a time"
```

## Accessibility

- Modal has proper ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation supported
- Close on Escape key
- Focus management
- Color contrast meets WCAG standards
- Screen reader friendly

## Analytics Tracking (Suggested)

Track these events:
- `appointment_edit_opened` - When modal opens
- `appointment_edit_date_changed` - When date is changed
- `appointment_edit_saved` - When save is successful
- `appointment_edit_cancelled` - When modal is closed without saving
- `appointment_edit_failed` - When save fails

## Security Considerations

### Data Validation
- Customer can only edit their own appointments
- Firebase security rules should verify:
  - User is authenticated
  - User owns the appointment
  - New time slot is available
  - New date is in the future

### Suggested Firestore Rules
```javascript
match /appointments/{appointmentId} {
  allow update: if request.auth != null 
    && request.auth.uid == resource.data.customerId
    && request.resource.data.start > request.time
    && !request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys()
      .hasAny(['serviceId', 'duration', 'bookedPrice']);
}
```

## Support Information
