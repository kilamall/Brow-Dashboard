- All errors logged with details
- Cleanup results reported with counts
- Failed cleanups retry on next scheduled run

### Monitoring
Each cleanup run logs:

## üö® Important Notes

### GDPR & Data Privacy
- Customer can request complete data deletion at any time
- Use `deleteCustomerDataClient()` function for GDPR requests
- Deletion includes all messages, appointments, analyses, etc.
- Cannot be undone once executed

### Backup Recommendations
Before enabling auto-cleanup:
1. Enable Firestore automatic backups (7-day retention recommended)
2. Set up Cloud Storage export for critical collections
3. Test cleanup on staging environment first

### Regulatory Compliance
This cleanup policy is designed to:
- ‚úÖ Maintain required business records
- ‚úÖ Preserve customer consent documentation
- ‚úÖ Keep appointment history for tax/accounting
- ‚úÖ Allow GDPR-compliant data deletion
- ‚úÖ Balance storage costs with data retention needs

### Adjusting Retention Periods
To modify retention periods, edit `/functions/src/enhanced-auto-cleanup.ts`:

```typescript
// Example: Change cancelled appointments from 30 to 60 days
const thirtyDaysAgo = new Date();
thirtyDaysAgo.setDate(thirtyDaysAgo.getDate() - 30);  // Change to -60
```

After changes:
```bash
cd functions
npm run build
firebase deploy --only functions:enhancedAutoCleanup
```

## üìà Storage Impact

### Before Auto-Cleanup
Estimated monthly growth without cleanup:
- SMS Logs: ~10MB/month
- Messages: ~5MB/month  
- Holds: ~2MB/month
- Cache Entries: ~50MB/month
- **Total: ~67MB/month**

### With Auto-Cleanup
Estimated steady-state storage:
- SMS Logs: ~27MB (90 days)
- Messages: ~5MB (last 50 per customer)
- Holds: <1MB (24 hours)
- Cache Entries: ~50MB (30 days)
- **Total: ~83MB steady state** (vs unlimited growth)

## üîí Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Auto-cleanup runs with admin privileges
- Manual cleanup requires admin authentication
- Cannot be triggered by customers
- Audit logs maintained for all cleanup operations

### Data Recovery
- No recovery after cleanup (by design)
- Enable Firestore backups for safety net
- Test cleanup policies in staging first
- Export critical data before major cleanups
