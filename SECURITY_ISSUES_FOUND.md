# ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Issues Found During Deployment

**Date**: October 17, 2025
**Severity**: HIGH

## üî¥ Critical Issue: Exposed API Key Still in Firebase Config

### Issue
While the code has been properly updated to use environment variables and secrets, the old Firebase Functions config still contains the exposed Gemini API key:

```
gemini.api_key: AIzaSyAsIbSKd9x7Gtn7KtHg5oIBG2zvV1_RgVc
```

This is the same key that was previously exposed in the codebase.

### Impact
- Old key may still be compromised
- Functions config will be deprecated in March 2026
- Should migrate to Firebase Secrets immediately

### Remediation Steps

#### 1. Verify New Secret is Working
The new GEMINI_API_KEY secret is already configured: `AIzaSyDxXI9OjWyL3y0XUUZmrydOE7N3kMMK-sU`

#### 2. Remove Old Config (After Deployment)
```bash
# After verifying new deployment works, remove old config:
firebase functions:config:unset gemini
firebase functions:config:unset twilio  # Also migrate to secrets
firebase functions:config:unset sendgrid  # Also migrate to secrets
```

#### 3. Revoke Old API Key
Go to Google Cloud Console and delete/revoke the old key: `AIzaSyAsIbSKd9x7Gtn7KtHg5oIBG2zvV1_RgVc`

#### 4. Migrate All Secrets
All credentials should use Firebase Secrets instead of functions config:
- GEMINI_API_KEY ‚úÖ (already migrated)
- SENDGRID_API_KEY ‚ö†Ô∏è (needs migration)
- AWS credentials ‚ö†Ô∏è (needs migration)
- Twilio credentials ‚ö†Ô∏è (needs migration)

### Status
- [ ] Old Gemini key revoked in Google Cloud Console
- [ ] Old functions config cleared
- [ ] All secrets migrated to Firebase Secrets
- [ ] Deployment tested with new secrets only

## üìã Additional Security Notes

### API Keys in Functions Config
The following sensitive data is stored in the old functions.config (deprecated):
- Gemini API Key (exposed and should be revoked)
- Twilio credentials (should migrate to secrets)
- SendGrid API Key (should migrate to secrets)

### Recommendation
After this deployment succeeds, plan a follow-up deployment to:
1. Migrate all credentials to Firebase Secrets
2. Remove all functions config
3. Update code to use secrets exclusively

---

**Action Required**: After deployment, immediately revoke the old Gemini API key from Google Cloud Console.
