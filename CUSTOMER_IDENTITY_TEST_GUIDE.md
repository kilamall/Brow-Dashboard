## üîç How to Debug

### Check Browser Console

Look for these logs:

**Good Signs** ‚úÖ:
```javascript
"‚úÖ Found customer by phone: +15551234567"
"‚úÖ Merged existing customer record with new auth account"
"‚úÖ Created new customer: abc123 (with auth)"
"‚úÖ Fetched 1 appointments for customer abc123"
```

**Bad Signs** ‚ùå:
```javascript
"No customer record found for uid: abc123"
"Failed to create customer record"
"Error calling findOrCreateCustomer"
```

### Check Firestore

**Navigate to**:
```
Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore Database
```

**Check `customers` collection**:
- Each customer should have:
  - `canonicalEmail` (lowercase) OR `canonicalPhone` (+15551234567)
  - `authUid` (if signed up) OR null (if admin-created)
  - `identityStatus`: "guest", "auth", or "merged"

**Check `appointments` collection**:
- Each appointment should have:
  - `customerId` matching a customer document
  - `customerEmail` and/or `customerPhone`

### Check Cloud Functions Logs

```bash
firebase functions:log --only findOrCreateCustomer
```

Look for:
```
"‚úÖ Found customer by phone: +15551234567"
"‚úÖ Updated existing customer: abc123"
"‚úÖ Created new customer: xyz789 (guest)"
```

## ‚ùå Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "No customer record found for uid"

**Cause**: Customer document not created during sign-up

**Fix**: 
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `findOrCreateCustomer` function deployed
- Check Cloud Functions logs for errors

### Issue: Duplicate customers created

**Cause**: Canonical normalization not working

**Fix**:
- Check Firestore indexes deployed
- Verify `canonicalEmail` and `canonicalPhone` fields exist
- Redeploy functions

### Issue: Appointments not showing in "My Bookings"

**Cause**: Customer ID mismatch

**Fix**:

- Verify customer has `authUid` field
- Check console logs for "No customer record found"

### Issue: Phone auth doesn't create customer

**Cause**: `findOrCreateCustomer` not called in phone auth flow

**Fix**:
- Check `Login.tsx` line ~310 for `findOrCreateCustomer` call
- Verify function deployed
- Check browser console for errors
